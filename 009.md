## Synopsis
Deals with the problem of "sloppy Christian living", explaining the meaning of baptism

## Transcript
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Let us hear the Word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday, as we find it written in Paul's letter to the Romans reading there in the 6th chapter, especially the 3rd verse.

**Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?**

And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord our strength and our Redeemer.

Amen.

In Christ Jesus, the Lord of our Christian life, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning, and you also Christian friends who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

Today, as you know, is the sixth Sunday after the festival of Trinity.

It is our custom on these After Trinity Sundays to deal with some of the common and practical problems of our Christian life and conduct.

You may recall that last Sunday we talked about getting along with one another,.

How to live in peace and harmony with one another.

And today we have a very practical thing that we want to talk about, and that is the matter of carelessness in our Christian life.

I like to call it sloppy Christian living, sloppy Christian living.

This kind of living where we're off the beam, we're either always to the left or we're always to the right, but in our Christian life it is a sloppy thing, it's a careless thing, it is an inferior thing.

It is a Christian life that is not becoming us as Christians.

You know, friends, it's a very easy thing to slip into a sloppy Christian life, isn't it?

It's very easy to look at our life and to not care whether we are doing the will of God or whether we are not doing it, not to care whether as we look at our life that it's a soggy thing.

And that it's something that we are rather ashamed of and It may all come very easily from this thing that we say something like this to ourselves, now we are saved by the forgiving grace of God, are we not?

And that's true, isn't it?

We are saved by the grace of God, and that means that you and I are not saved by our life, isn't that right?

And because we are saved by the forgiving grace of God.

And that our lives do not save us, it's the easiest thing in the world, especially for us Lutherans, to get the idea that life therefore is not very important.

Because if life doesn't save, what's the difference.

How I live?

What's the difference therefore whether my Christian life is sloppy, whether it doesn't measure up, whether it's absolutely inferior, whether it's the kind of a life that is not becoming me as a Christian?

What's the difference?

After all, isn't it foolishness to live on the beam when we are not saved by our life?

Some of us may even draw this conclusion.

We may say why the thing that we ought to do is to go out and to sin to our hearts content, because the more we sin, the more we show the world.

How great is the forgiving grace of God.

If we go out and kill and live in adultery and murder, why the world would say, my.

How tremendously vast is the grace of God that forgives, and actually we would be glorifying grace.

That's the way some Christians sometimes feel about their Christian life, and that's why today we want to talk about this thing of carelessness, of indifference, of sloppy Christian living.

Doesn't it make any difference even though we are saved by the saving grace of God and our lives do not save us?

The speaker this morning from the Word of God is the Apostle Paul, the little Jew from up in Tarsus in Cilicia, the great war horse of the Christian church, and we find him writing to his Christian congregation at Rome, and yet then when he had spoken to them about the very fact that we are saved by the forgiving grace of God, and there was a danger that because they would know that they were saved by the mercy of God in Christ Jesus and not by their lives, that somehow or other they would get the idea that the Christian life is not important, and that they would go out and say now I can sin to my heart's content.

It doesn't make any difference, and therefore I do not have to avoid being off of the beam, and so he wrote to them as he speaks to you and me this morning assuring us that we are saved by the forgiving grace of God to be sure, assuring us that you and I are not saved by our lives, and but therefore telling and calling to us as Christians to avoid being off of the beam, to avoid carelessness in a sloppy Christian life, to avoid anything that doesn't measure up, because this is what he told the Christians at Rome.

He says do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

Do you not realize that because you were baptized into Christ's death that therefore you must avoid being off of the beam in your Christian life?

You've got to get rid of a sloppy Christian living.

You've got to get rid of that which is inferior.

You dare not be off of the beam.

You've got to be on the beam even though you are not saved by your life because when you were baptized do you not know that you were baptized into his death?

That's well this morning as we are here in God's house to take a look at our baptism and to realize just what it has meant to us.

And what it means to be baptized into Christ's death.

If there is anything in the world that ought to cause you and me to avoid being off of the beam, to avoid sloppy Christian living, the kind of living that just doesn't measure up, it is not becoming you and me.

It ought to be this we were baptized into Jesus Christ and thus into his death.

And that in the first place means this that when you and I were baptized and baptized into his death that means that we were joined to Christ's death, that death which made it possible for the forgiving grace of God to operate.

How many of us realize this that if Christ had not died the grace of God could never have forgiven sin.

Some people say well God is a forgiving God, he's gracious and he's merciful therefore God can forgive sins easily but listen God himself could not forgive sins had it not been for the death of his son Jesus Christ.

The second person of the Trinity, God the Son, had to come out of the ivory palaces into this world of sin, become a human being without sin, and he had to go to Calvary's cross and there he had to die.

Why?

Because God is a God of grace but he's also a God of justice.

And being a God of justice when the soul sins and it's punishable by death God must carry out that verdict of justice.

And therefore for God to be merciful, for God to forgive on the basis of grace Christ had to die.

And he had to meet the justice of God.

And you and I don't understand Calvary until we stand there.

And say there was God's Son who willingly met the justice of God.

He on the cross he bore the guilt.

And the punishment of the world, he endured the equal of an eternity in hell for the human race.

And he met the justice of God so that by meeting God's justice therefore it was possible for God who is merciful and gracious to have a forgiving grace and to forgive sins.

And therefore when you and I were baptized we received, we were given this forgiving grace of God.

How many of us realize that the greatest thing that has ever happened to you and me has been our baptism.

When in infancy you and I were brought by means of water and the Word of God in baptism something tremendous happened.

And what happened in baptism we were united and joined to the death of Christ and the merciful forgiveness of God became ours and we were forgiven our sins delivered from hell and damnation.

And given eternal life and bear in mind when on the day of your baptism in mine that tremendous miracle of God's grace happened that grace was given you and me to save us never to be exploited.

What happens when a Christian who has been baptized into Christ's death doesn't care.

How he lives?

What happens when he's off of the beam?

What happens when his Christian life is sloppy?

It's everything but what it ought to be.

When your life and mine is sloppy even though we are not saved by our life that means that we are looking at God's grace and we are making it mean that God is stupid.

Listen, can you think of a greater crime than to look at God's merciful grace and to try to interpret it in such a way that God ends up being stupid?

That's what we do.

You may say what do you mean?

God's grace was given for one reason to save yet it's possible for many a Christian look at God's grace and to say God I've got an angle.

God you're rather stupid I know.

How to get around you.

Your grace is so great to forgive me therefore since it's so vast and I'm not saved by my life I can go out and live just as I please and I'll go out and sin to the very limits of my ability and your grace is always bigger.

In other words we say to God, God you're not so smart as you think you are I'm a little more clever than you are.

I've got a way around this thing that I can live as I please I can be off of the beam and still be saved because your grace is big enough to allow me to do as I please.

And listen whenever you and I accuse God of being stupid whenever you and I say God I can take advantage of you and I can exploit you whenever you and I play God for a fool watch out.

Listen friends the forgiving grace of God was given for one reason that was to save.

Never that you and I could say God I'm clever I can get around it and I'll live as I please off of the beam and your grace is so big that it will forgive me.

You know it's like this supposing a man were dying of the horrible venereal disease.

And realizing that he was dying of it because of a profligate life he found that there was a medication that would arrest it.

And then he would take that cure that would arrest this venereal disease only to say the reason for the medical cure is that I can go back and live as I did.

And when any Christian accepts the grace of God only to interpret it as God you're a sap and you're a fool and you're stupid that's my indication that I can go back and live again that man's lost the cure for venereal disease was never given to allow a man to wallow in sin that's what the Word of God means when we like dogs we go back and eat our vomit.

Whenever you and I know we're not saved by our life but whenever on the day of baptism we were given the forgiven grace of God it's time that we as Christians will realize that it was given for one reason to say never to allow you and me to exploit God and say God you're stupid I'm more clever than you I can go out and live as a please because your grace is greater than my sin God forbid perish the thought.

And that's why today when again we realize that we're saved by the forgiving grace of God we're not saved by our life but when St. Paul calls upon you and me to say avoid sloppy Christian living when you and I live and our life doesn't measure up to what it ought to be.

And we know it.

And we don't care when we're off of the beam.

And we say what's the difference I can live as I please.

I can sin to my heart's content today ought to be the day when we say to ourselves I was baptized when I was baptized I was baptized and I became sharers of Christ's death and I received the grace of God and therefore we ought to say to ourselves I am going to be on the beam I shall avoid anything in my Christian life that puts me to the right or to the left of Center.

God wants no sloppy Christian living when we can say that and mean it then and only then will we begin to appreciate what it means that we have been baptized you know Paul appreciated his baptism immensely did he not.

He was on the way to Damascus you know up in Syria when he met his Lord.

And he was sticken with blindness.

And he went into Damascus.

And he stayed there for three days.

And he was blinded at that time.

And he was neither able to eat or to drink.

And then the Lord God went to a man.

And said to him his name was Ananias he is not the other Ananias.

You know it's too bad they both have the same name he's not the Ananias and Safira who were liars but there was another Ananias a Christian living up there in Damascus.

And God told Ananias to go to a street called straight into a home of a man of the name of Judas.

And there again it was not Judas Iscariot Judas Iscariot was dead he went to the home of man name of Judas.

And he went there.

And he said you shall find this man Saul of Tarsus.

And Ananias went you know.

And again when he put his hands on him.

And prayed us Paul was able to see again.

And then we are told that Paul was baptized the grace of God was granted and sealed to him the very death of Jesus Christ.

And because he was baptized it meant a tremendous thing.

How thankful we ought to be that in baptism again we became children of God and the mercy and the grace of God became ours.

How thankful that we have had parents who in infancy again have brought us as infants to the kingdom of God because even children are born in sin and they need to be regenerated and they need the mercy of God.

And the very fact that we have been baptized it ought to be the greatest occasion of your life and mine.

That is when God did something we were baptized in connection with Christ's death the death that brought life and salvation and enabled even our God to be a God of mercy oh we are saved by grace.

And you know especially we Lutherans we say if I'm saved by grace therefore doesn't make any difference.

How I live life isn't very important it's foolish to watch your life and yet again we're talking about this thing of careless Christian living sloppiness yes just being run over at the heels type of who cares.

How we live the idea of a god do just about as we please God forbid says Paul don't you realize that when you were baptized into Christ Jesus you were baptized into his death.

And we say well what does that mean well it not only means that we were baptized into his death that made it possible for God to be gracious but we were baptized we were joined to Christ death which occurred once and for all thank God Christ died once and for all he didn't have to die a number of times when he who was the God man went to Calvary his great sacrifice was sufficient for all of our sins and also for the sins of the world the Word of God assures us that it was a timeless sacrifice it was a sacrifice as the lamb slain from the foundations of the world when he died to sin that was it he paid the price and he was done and finished with sin now Paul makes a comparison Paul said now you are baptized when you were baptized in connection with his death you are sharers of that death that like as Christ was finished with sin so are you finished with sin you also have died unto sin when we have died unto sin we have died in baptism because Christ came to live in our hearts.

And when he came to live in our hearts the day that you and I were baptized he came to give us power in order to resist the temptations and the enticements of life.

How can you and I who have Christ living within us who have died therefore to sin.

How in the world can we as a Christian ever say that sloppy Christian living is alright we can live a life that leaves a lot to be desired.

It doesn't make any difference whether we measure up it doesn't make any difference whether we're on the beam or whether we're off of the beam.

How in the world can a child of God that is baptized ever say that when in baptism he has been connected with the death of Jesus?

Paul says we are dead to sin like a dead man take a dead man who has died from acute alcoholism.

Alright he's here in the casket he's died because he is drunk to excess you can line that man's casket with all the alcoholic beverages you want you can surround that casket with all of the alcohol you want that man's dead and there is no enticement anymore he's dead to that temptation or you can take a man that has died because of profligate living and you can surround that casket when he's dead with all of the Christine tealers and all of the call girls in the world and they can stand there and entice and Induce but he's dead therefore he is immune to temptation.

And in the same way when you and I were baptized and Christ moved into your heart and mine by faith he gave us power so that as he died once and for all for sin by turning to him for power you and I have died once and for all to temptation and to enticement.

And therefore when it's shoddy Christian living when it's sloppy living when you and I are not on the beam when your life and mine leave so much to be desired and we know it and we don't care what are we doing we are saying to Jesus Christ who came to live with us when we were baptized I don't want you as Savior we are saying to him get out of my life we are saying to him as far as Calvary's concerned you didn't have to die for me.

And may I say with all the strength of my own soul that any man that defies Jesus Christ and drives him out of his life is lost he's lost because of his life not because the forgiving grace of God failed but because by sloppy Christian living he drove Jesus Christ from his life and that's why you and I today when again we talk about salvation by grace and that's true.

And we say we're not saved by our life and that's true but nevertheless it does not follow from those two truths that it makes no difference.

How you and I live.

We dare not say that we can be off of the beam.

Paul called with the intensity of his being to the Roman Christians you have got to see to it that you're not off of the beam.

Away with careless Christian living and if we would determine today as baptized Christians that we are going to see to it that we are never off of the beam but to the strength that we have in Jesus Christ we are going to therefore avoid careless Christian living then there would be some discipline in our life.

How many of us when we became a Christian or when we were baptized or embraced Christ ever said to ourselves now it's something where I've got to discipline my life you know we sing the old song take my life and let it be.

And that's just about the way some Christians feel about it they stop to take my life Lord.

And let it be just as it is I want it for one and I want to live just as I please and I'm going to fulfill the lusts of my heart and don't you get in my way take my life Lord and save me but let me be but the hymn says take my life and let it be consecrated Lord to the tremendous difference.

When the athlete gets ready he disciplines himself and he trains himself.

How many of us train ourselves to be on the beam.

How many of us say it's of utmost importance that our lives shall not be sloppy Christian lives but will be on the beam to have lives that are commensurate with our Christian faith to have lives that measure up to a certain degree with what that life ought to be because we are baptized when God says I shall have no other gods before me.

How many of us disciplined ourselves and say God's got to come first when God says not to take his name in vain.

How many of us have controlled ourselves that blasphemy and cursing do not come from our hearts because it's wrong we're off the beam when God says remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

How many of us discipline ourselves to say that we're going to worship God and be in his house unless God makes it absolutely impossible.

How many of us have ever disciplined or is our prayer be take my life and let it be don't you bother me Lord don't get in my way I'm going to sin to my heart's content.

Honor thy father and thy mother.

How many of us are disciplined in life beyond the beam with honoring our parents.

And God says thou shalt not kill.

How many of us say hatred is wrong whether it's in your heart or mine.

And therefore the hatred is something that dare not be found in the Christian life because you're off the beam that's sloppy Christian living that is dethroning Christ.

Thou shalt not committed adultery.

How many of us looking into our own hearts have got to say away with sinful thoughts and desires I've been baptism died to sin.

Thou shalt not steal.

Honesty in business honesty with one another.

Bearing false witness.

Watching the tongue that we speak in love.

Not coveting.

How many of us have disciplined ourselves or is it only this take my life and let it be that it's a great party.

And we say boy this is heaven to what a chump is God.

And oh how stupid God can you be to save us by grace that leaves us.

And out we can go out and live just as we please.

No you can't live just as you please you and I were baptized into his death.

And that also means this that when we were baptized into the death of Jesus Christ we were put into a relationship we were joined to his death which occurred once.

And that was followed by his resurrection Paul says Christ died once and then he rose again.

And we know that he did he arose from the dead showing that he had gained the salvation that he had again atoned for on Calvary.

And now Paul makes an analogy he says Christ died to sin then he arose to a new life then again that human nature of his shared and all the glory of the divine nature true God and true man.

And he appeared and he disappeared to the disciples and to his followers there was the glory that was his.

A newness of life.

Paul says in the same way when you were baptized into his death he died to sin.

And then he says you arose to a new life why because the Holy Spirit came to dwell in our hearts baptism means as something happened to you and me something miraculous what happened why we were born of water and the Spirit we were born again the Holy Ghost on the day of your baptism in mine he came into our hearts for the first time or sealed himself when we were baptized.

And when the Holy Spirit came into your hearts and life and mine we were born a second time there was a living faith in Jesus Christ.

And when the Holy Spirit came to dwell in us he came so that our lives when we would strive would be pleasing to God isn't it a marvelous thing to know that the Spirit of God dwells in you and me since the day of our baptism when we were baptized as infants that it sealed to us as we were baptized as adults.

And that Holy Spirit takes the efforts of your life and mine.

And he adds the righteousness of Jesus Christ that our life becomes pleasing to God.

And listen in the moment when we say to ourselves it doesn't make any difference how I live I can live a sloppy Christian life I don't have to measure up I can just be a laissez-faire individual and let it go and come and let my life be just as it is.

But in the moment when that becomes our attitude what are we doing we're grieving the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit crying and striving with you and me struggling to get us again to live as God would have us live and we say no the tremendous danger is this that we hardened our hearts we hardened our consciences to the point where we can harden our hearts at the Holy Spirit will leave your life and mine and never come back we'll never want him back.

And we've committed the sin against the Holy Ghost the unpardonable sin which is nothing but rebellion.

And you and I can lose life and salvation in the name of Jesus by living lives that are careless and sloppy and off the beam and sinning against the Holy Ghost.

Oh we are saved by grace yes we Lutherans we shouted to the heavens and that's the very joy of our church but let me tell you Lutheran Christians it's also a danger don't you ever draw the conclusion that God is stupid because he saved us by grace.

And that therefore it doesn't make any difference.

How we live.

And we can be off of the beam.

And live a sloppy life and grace is sufficient whenever there is sloppiness in your life and mine.

And we know it we're grieving the Holy Spirit.

And that's a dangerous dangerous thing.

Today we ought to say to us thank God we are saved by his forgiving grace it's the only way he could save us.

But oh if we just live as baptized Christians ought to live who have been baptized into Christ death who are new people in him who are born again of the Holy Spirit.

What it would mean if we would just live as baptized Christians saying I'm going to get on the beam I've got to be right there right in center who knows what's going to happen oh it's wonderful to be on the beam.

And again no sloppy living you know Paul finally was brought back to Rome after he had him prison been in prison for two years.

And he stood before his executioner and It was a matter of life and death.

And the big thing was Paul if you confess Jesus Christ as Lord your head is going to be cut off.

He didn't have to have his head cut off.

Somebody said what would Paul what would he have had to have done to in order to have saved himself from execution why it was a simple thing if Paul when he stood in Rome and I stood at the place where tradition says he was beheaded.

If when Paul stood there and they asked him do you embrace Jesus Christ, if he had been willing to take a little salt throw it over his shoulder pronounce the name of the Emperor have you to said Oh Nero and would have called upon one of the Roman God said Oh Jupiter, that man could have walked out of there scot-free with his life.

We might say to ourselves well now wait a minute wouldn't have made much difference would why didn't he take a little salt go over shoulder why didn't he say Oh Nero why didn't he say Oh Jupiter.

And he could have walked out oh he could have been a great help to the church why because Paul had been baptized into the death of Jesus.

And he knew that the saving grace of God was meant to save him never to use it and to look at God to use it as a way of escape and to interpret it as being something from a stupid God.

And because Paul's life is he lived it it wasn't a soggy looking thing it was something again it was not sloppy.

And because he lived in Christ he stood there.

And he said no there'll be no salt thrown over my shoulder I'll not call on Nero I'll not call on Jupiter I put my faith and my trust in Jesus Christ.

And again the sword cut that head from that body.

And he gave his life because again he knew the joy of living a life and being on the beam.

When we have lived our lives on the beam with the power of Jesus Christ because we have been baptized into his death think of the joy that awaits us.

Yesterday we talked about the eclipse of the Sun didn't we we were told not to look at it for a length of time lest indeed the brightness of the light of the rays would burn the eyes imagine what it will be when we have been on the ball showing that our faith in Jesus Christ and In his grace as a living thing when we shall see the great beam Jesus Christ.

And our eyes shall behold him.

And we shall not be blinded but we shall see him who is the brightest beam because he is God himself.

Oh to do away with sloppiness in Christian living to do away with the idea that it doesn't make any difference to do away with the idea that it doesn't matter whether we're on the beam or off the beam.

Oh to God that we could walk the glory road and we could have the assurance that comes when we can say to ourselves I know that when I was baptized thank God I was baptized into Christ death and then a life well that gives evidence that we are still in grace.

And we can sing on the glory road blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.

Oh what a foretaste of glory divine.

Heir of salvation.

Purchased by God.

Born of his spirit.

Washed in his blood.

This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.

This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.

God grant that you and I can be on the beam.

Amen.

The peace of God which passeth all human understanding keep and unite your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus unto life everlasting.
