## Synopsis
For citizens of Heaven, adversity is a loving act of God.  Worldliness->adversity->despondency->repentance  Suicide is the ultimate rebellion - the refusal to repent - and is not forgivable.  In softening the true message of Christianity (the cross), the ecumenical movement has excised the most important thing.  It is possible to love Christ (the Teacher) without being saved.  We're only passing through.  Incurable illness makes us homesick.

## Transcript
Grace be unto you and peace from god our father ran from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

Let us hear the word of God our regular epistolary lesson for this sunday as we find a written in Paul's letter to the Philippians in the third chapter especially the 20th verse.

**For our citizenship is in heaven.**

And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord our Strength and our Redeemer.

Amen.

In Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning and you also Christian friends who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

On Sunday, you recall, our text was taken from Paul's letter to the Philippians and today it is also taken from that same letter.

It was while Paul was on his second missionary journey you remember that he went over into Macedonia up into the city of Philippi and there he established the first Christian congregation on the continent of Europe.

Paul always loved that congregation dearly so that years later when he was a prisoner in Rome he wrote a letter to that congregation and we know it as the letter to the Philippian congregation.

And in our text this morning, Paul is telling the Philippian Christians what their high position is as Christians.

He is telling them what an exalted position is theirs because they are children of God.

What a high, enviable position it is and then he tells them just what that position, that status is since they are Christians.

He said our citizenship is in heaven.

In other words, he says Philippian Christians, because you are Christians, this is your high position.

You are no less than citizens of heaven.

You are not citizens of earth.

You are not citizens of this world.

You are no less than citizens of the heavenly country.

And the same Paul speaks to you and me this morning through the word of God reminding us that as Christians this is our high status.

It is our incomparable position that we are no less than citizens of heaven, citizens of the heavenly kingdom, not citizens of the earth.

And sometimes I suppose in your life and mine it's true, statements like that leave us cold, do they not?

We say to ourselves, all right, so I am a citizen of heaven.

I am not a citizen of earth.

What about it?

Is that such an exalted position after all?

And in your life and mine there are times, are there not, when we say to ourselves, well I don't know whether that is such an exalted, enviable, incomparable position that I am a citizen of heaven.

We may say sometimes it seems like citizens of the earth, citizens of this world have the odds in their favor.

They have the advantages.

They seem to have the blessings.

We do not seem to have the blessings and the advantages that citizens of this earth have.

Then we begin to wonder, do we not?

You know today is the second last Sunday of the present church year.

Next Sunday brings this church year to an end.

For we remember that the calendar year of course begins on January the first, but the church year does not begin at that time.

It begins the first Sunday in Advent, which happens to be the first Sunday in December this year.

The church year ends next Sunday, and as we think about the lengthening of days and as we think about our departure from this world, it is well that this morning we take a look at our position, at our status, and if this is such a mighty position, such
a high calling that we are no less than citizens of heaven and not citizens of earth, we ought to look at it to see whether the odds, the blessings, the advantages are not on our side, not on the side of citizens of this world or of this earth.

On the basis of the word of God, Paul, when he wrote to the Philippians, he was filled with this joy.

We are no less, he says, than citizens of heaven.

We are not citizens of the earth, and the advantages are ours if we just stop the thing for a moment, because in the first place, let's know this, being citizens of heaven because we are Christians, that means this.

It means that we are friends of the cross of Christ.

We are, on the contrary, not enemies of the cross of Christ as our citizens of this earth.

Paul aptly describes what he means by citizens of the earth or of this world.

He says there are many that walk and he told the Philippians, and I've mentioned this to you before, and he says now I mention it to you again with tears, that he says they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.

Who is a citizen of this world, not a citizen of heaven?

Any man who is an enemy of the cross of Christ.

You know, those are words that you've got to look at twice.

You notice Paul does not say by inspiration they are enemies of Christ.

He says they are enemies of the cross of Christ.

There's a tremendous difference.

Many a citizen of this earth, of this world, who is not a citizen of heaven, is not an enemy of Christ.

Oh, many a citizen of this earth loves him.

He will tell you that Christ is the greatest teacher that ever lived.

He will point you to the Sermon on the Mountain and say, isn't it wonderful?

Look what he taught.

And then many a citizen of this earth will point to Christ and say, what a marvelous example.

There is no greater example in all the world than Christ.

They will thrill to him and say, if you walk in the way which he gave as a pattern, then that's all you need.

They love him as a teacher and they love him as an example.

But they are enemies of the cross of Christ.

There is something about the cross that the citizen of this earth doesn't like.

He has no room in his life for the cross.

Why?

You say the cross of Jesus means his death.

And therefore, the man of the world says, as far as I'm concerned, he didn't have to die on the cross.

All that you need is to have him as a teacher and all that you need is to have him as an example and then follow him.

Live like he lived.

Be good to your neighbor.

Live a clean, decent life, a good moral life.

Be honest.

Be above reproach and that's all you need for salvation.

You see, he looks at the cross and he says, that's slaughterhouse religion.

That's the blood.

I do not want the blood.

But you see, Paul says he is an enemy of the cross of Christ.

Why?

Because look at Jesus.

He did not come into this world to be primarily a teacher.

Jesus Christ didn't come into this world to be primarily an example in which you and I are to follow him and walk.

He came primarily and foremost to die.

And when a man looks at Jesus and he denies the very reason why he came, he takes unto himself something that is secondary.

Jesus Christ came for the cross.

Why?

Because he knew that who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, not one.

He knew that you and I, if we follow him by an example, cannot save ourselves.

He knew that you and I could never be perfect, that he is a perfect example and we can never attain to perfection.

And so that's why he, God's son, came out of the ivory palaces and went to the cross to die because in that death he knew that he would have to atone for our guilt and for our punishment, that in his death and in his death alone, salvation might be possible
for the human race.

A man who is a citizen of this earth is a man that may love Christ, but he's an enemy of the cross.

And therefore we say, where is there any advantage?

A child of God who is a citizen of heaven, he is a friend of the cross of Christ because that's the center of what he believes.

It is the cross because he stands at the foot of Calvary and he confesses his sins and he knows that within himself there dwelleth no good thing and he knows that only by the shed blood of Jesus Christ is there forgiveness, life and salvation.

And therefore when we are citizens of heaven, listen, the advantage is on our side, the blessing is on our side because ours is the advantage at the end of life of heaven.

And the man who is a citizen of this earth, his is hell.

There is a tremendous difference, is there not?

Without the cross, without Jesus Christ that died, friend, if all you can see in him that he was only a teacher, that he was only an example, you are an enemy of the cross of Christ and you are denying that which is vital and that which is necessary and
no man shall see heaven on the basis of following Jesus as an example.

It's the cross that stands paramount and that stands center in Christian theology and that must stand as a friend in your life and mine.

Is there any difference between heaven and hell?

When Jesus talked about Judas who lost his salvation he said it were better for that man that he had never been born.

Then he said one day for what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

If you had the whole world and you lost your soul and you lost the citizenship of heaven, Jesus says you're the loser because there are no compensations.

That's the loss for which nothing can make up for it.

It were better that you and I had never been born.

It's strange as an opinion to our lives when we are reminded we are citizens of heaven not this earth but sometimes we still feel that the advantages, the blessings, again the real privileges, the odds are all on the side of the other person but there
is a difference.

The difference is heaven with God eternally or hell.

Paul says again their end is destruction, their end is perdition.

Perdition again.

Satan is the son of perdition and eternity separated from the very presence of God's grace and God's mercy.

The advantages, the blessings are on our side.

What a noble position, what a noble place, what an enviable stand and status is ours.

We are citizens of heaven not of this earth and if this morning on the second last Sunday of the year is the day's length and we think about the end of time, if you and I could take that truth and write it onto our hearts never to forget it, that we are citizens
of heaven not of this earth then we would watch into our life that no man under any circumstances will ever take away from you and me the Christ of the cross.

Oh and all of the ecumenical movements that are going on in there, fine, bear this in mind, there is one central truth that we dare not lose and that is the Christ that died.

When you take Calvary away from Jesus you've got nothing left.

He is vital.

On my trip recently when I was in Europe I was in Geneva, Switzerland and we passed the place of the United Nations assembly which was in session then we rode along and we came to a place of a rock and there was a plaque on the rock that said this place
marks the place where Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations had its beginning and they were they held their meetings in Geneva, Switzerland and when you think that in World War I eight million five hundred thousand young men of the nations of the
world lost their lives in World War I and our great president Woodrow Wilson said this shall not happen again and there was the League of Nations with his famous fourteen points but Woodrow Wilson found out to his sorrow that the fourteen points
of the League of Nations that the thirteen thousand minute points of international law could not prevent another war and he himself wrote that if civilization is to stand man must be redeemed spiritually and that's it and when man is redeemed
spiritually don't forget he is redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ there is no other way don't let it slip through your fingers and mind we have an exalted position we are citizens of no less than heaven of the heavenly country not of this
earth well that means that we are friends of the cross of Jesus Christ if you can emblazon it on your soul and mind this morning that we'll never forget that don't let anybody under any circumstances take from you and me the Christ of the cross Paul
put it this way I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes when he wrote to the Philippians Paul was reminding him look at our exalted position he said Philippians ask Christians this
is your position this is your exalted place this is your great status you are citizens of no less than heaven itself not citizens of earth and therefore the advantages and the blessings and the odds are all on our side even though at times we may wonder
about them because in the second place let's know this that being citizens of heaven means this that God is our God in contrast to those who are citizens of this earth whose God is their belly Paul says whose God is their belly who glory in their shame
who mind earthly things what's he talking about the man of the world the man who is not a citizen of heaven he has a God but it's not God it is again his own belly or his own stomach or his own cravings within he has one aim in life and that is to get all that
he can of the material things of life because to him life consists only in the abundance of the things which a man has and therefore you've got to get and you've got to have if you are going to be happy he knows no God but his own cravings and he craves
and he craves and he goes on because he spends and absorbs all of his time in the things of this life because the man that is a citizen of this earth is thoroughly convinced that the only joy and happiness that he shall find will be in the material things
of life how about citizens of heaven citizens of heaven have as their God God himself and when you and I as Christians have as our God God and not the cravings of our own hearts for the material things of life then we allow God to remind us of the fact
that we are not citizens of this earth because we are transients we are pilgrims we're just passing through we're tourists we have no abiding city here and God writes it on your soul and mind that we are just strangers and pilgrims and therefore
God warns you and me not to wrap ourselves too tightly around the things of this life because we aren't going to be here very long we're just passing through we are only tourists we are not citizens of the earth and when God Almighty warns you and me
that we are not to become so completely absorbed into our life that these things shall overshadow him and that these things will dim God into our life and blind us then we have this advantage the advantage of being citizens of heaven that we have
peace with God whether God blesses us with a lot of material things with very little and the man who is a citizen of this life has no peace within even though he should own the world the man that is a citizen of the man that lives as a citizen of this life
soon finds out that there is only a passing satisfaction in the material things of life as soon as something is acquired the craving starts all over again with something more and the man craves and he craves and then comes fear fear of losing what
he's got and so he lives there is no peace of mind because God made you and me that conscience that part within you and me that is the moral stamina on the door of quality that voice of God within us can never be satisfied by the material things but when
again our God is the true God and not our belly then we know this that God in pointing us to him having him and Jesus Christ we have peace with God everything is all right we are saved it matters not then whether God blesses us with abundance or not many
a child of God has been blessed with abundance Abraham was an extremely wealthy man Isaac and Jacob were extremely wealthy people David and Solomon were extremely wealthy Joseph of Arimathea was an extremely wealthy man Nicodemus was a wealthy
man but again they knew that they were citizens of heaven and never were these things allowed to blot out God the advantages are on our side because citizens of heaven have peace within and when there is restlessness within which means that there
is a soul without God in Jesus Christ there is no peace there is no happiness there is no content on this second last Sunday of the church year all that God would write it on your soul and on mine that we are citizens of heaven not citizens of this earth
just pilgrims if we would write it there never to forget it then whenever adversity comes in your life and mine we will gladly accept it and we will stop feeling sorry for ourselves and becoming despondent why does God send adversity in your life
and mine sparing none of us John Milton put it this way he said sweet are the uses of adversity which like a toad ugly and venomous hath yet a jewel beneath her crown have you ever asked why does God send adversity in your life and mine we who are citizens
of heaven you want to know one reason because God knows how weak you are and how weak I am and how easy it is to become so absorbed in the things of this life I mean honestly I do not mean being crooked I mean getting these things in an honest and an upright
way but God knows that you and I can get so absorbed in these things that somehow rather they choke out God and they blind God to us then God because he loves you and me knows something's got to be done he isn't going to give you and me up that easily and
then he sends adversity why because God knows if there is anything that will make you and me stop if we're getting too absorbed in these earthly things and say wait a minute wait a minute I am so absorbed I am forgetting God but adversity will do it
I talked to a man when he was offered a job twenty five thousand dollars a year what a salary what an increase for him and as we spoke he said to me don't worry about that money he said you see God took my son when he took my son I know I'm not going to wrap
myself around the things of life why was it that one of you said when you had your new home all built that you were afraid to move into it because you thought something might happen isn't it strange if in your life and mine we are prone to be so absorbed
in a good way with decent material things that we might blind God out of our life that then adversity comes and we say wait a minute God something's wrong that's when we ought to thank God and say thanks God that you've taught me that I am a stranger
and a pilgrim here and that I'm not a citizen of this earth but what do we do sometimes we get the blues and we start feeling sorry for ourselves and we start down the road of despondency what is despondency listen despondency means this that I'm a
bitter and put out at God and I say God you oughtn't to treat me that way God that isn't right I'm hurt and therefore we get the blues and we get depressed and we think God's got something against us when the very opposite is true God's trying to get you
and me to put him back where he belongs then we start down that horrible tragic road of despondency I'm mentioning this because I've got it on my heart not less than three people this last week have been to see me because they were despondent and talking
about taking their life and one of them said to me what's the difference if I take my life I only hurt myself don't I what's the difference now we're talking about all of us on this side of the Jordan you who are alive and I'm alive what about this thing
when I get depressed and I get despondent because I'm a bit put out at God do I have the right to take my life because I am going to hurt only myself do you know of any place in the word of God where because I'm feeling sorry for myself that I've got a right
to take my life you know of any place like that you know that any place where that would excuse it that doesn't excuse it does it the big thing is we may say no man in his right mind would take his life God judges that not I and I would never step in where
God belongs but listen if you are deliberately planning right now is the time to do some thinking over 200,000 in our country every year attempted over 30,000 completed may I ask you right now from the bottom of my heart to yours do you know what you're
doing right now are you accountable for your life if you're on the road to despondency answer me do you know you're on the road are you accountable do you know right from wrong right now oh not when the deed is done but what are you now did you have sense
enough to come to church or not to come to church are you have sense enough now to listen or not listen do you know what you're doing do you have a knowledge of writing long listen to take one's life as a deliberate act and therefore it depends on this
am I accountable when I deliberately plan to take my life a man only hurts himself is that right why there's something about taking my life that is different than if I take the life of somebody else if I took your life there would still be time that
I could repent that I could get right with God but you see when I take my own life deliberately when I plan to do it just because I'm on the road that's despondency and I take my own life don't you realize that then you and I stand before Almighty God in
death with our blood on our own soul and there isn't any time for repentance when death takes place the word of God knows no place after death for repentance you may say to me well can I repent ahead of time well listen the very essence of repentance
is this that if I'm sorry I won't do it you can't do it ahead of time that's the tragedy I'm talking to you and to myself on this side of the Jordan God's that judge when these things take place not you and I doesn't a man hurt only himself but oh God what
you and I can do to ourselves write it on your soul this morning will you when you start walking down that damnable horrible dark road of despondency for God's sake don't think that it's pleasing God say to yourself God I'm sorry that I'm irked at
you and for God's sake turn around and come back and talk to someone could I say it any clearer I have to say it it's on my hand there's too many of you who are talking about this thing you don't want to live because you're feeling sorry for yourselves
I'm at your service 24 hours out of the day you and I are citizens of heaven don't walk that road don't go down that road and let somebody take the heavenly citizenship away because we are despondent it's a bad road stay off don't ever get on it never
never when Paul wrote to the Philippians he was writing with a thrill in his heart and he was reminding them this is your high calling we are citizens of heaven think of it no less than citizens of heaven not citizens of earth we're only pilgrims here
and some of them wondered and again as you and I wonder we said the odds the advantages the blessings all seem on the other side but they aren't because listen being citizens of heaven's Christian means they said we are awaiting the return of Jesus
Christ Paul put it this way he said our school is in heaven from whence we look for the savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even
to do all things under himself and that marvelous Paul said listen we as Christians we wait for his return the man of the world the citizen of the earth isn't waiting for Christ to come again he doesn't believe he's coming but you and I know that before
he died he said he died and he said and after I die I will rise again he arose and we know that he went up the slope of the Mount of Olives one day and I walked it and I was there well again he blessed 11 and he went to heaven the angel said he's coming back remember
that oh he's coming back he conquered the grave what's going to keep him from coming back he is coming back and then when he comes back what is our advantage but when he comes he has told us this that our bodies can go down in the graves and he will raise
them up and we will put on a glorified body a body like the son of God has no longer touched by sickness and disease and those who are only citizens of this world will put on a corruptible body which will be a body for damnation there is a tremendous advantage
on our side when we stop to think and on this second last Sunday of the church year when the shadows begin to lengthen we begin to think about the end of time what we not then if we write it on our souls God don't ever let me forget it I'm a citizen of heaven
I'm only a stranger I'm only a tourist I'm only a pilgrim I'm only passing through here I don't belong here and therefore don't let me get so absorbed in the things of this life God that I've blocked you out of my life oh then we ought to be examples to
one another and to encourage one another when sickness comes ought we not what ought we to do as Christians oh death's gonna look for causes and that you are going to die and so am I and death's gonna find some reason to choose me sickness and that sickness
can take multiple forms all the time they come in your body mind will start to slowly waste away and everybody can see it but oh we can follow the example of Paul can't we and we can go to one another and say all these bodies of ours they can become so contaminated
with sin and they can go down at all they can be so destroyed with all kinds of vermin and all kinds of diseases but oh when Christ comes again we can say but we're going to put on a new body it's going to be a changed body it's going to be a glorious glorified
body never again showing the signs of sickness and disease and then when we can encourage one another doesn't it mean this that as the shadows lengthen if sickness has come to us especially in curable illness we can thank God for it because you know
God has a purpose in that that's the way God makes us homesick doesn't he you know we can even be a tourist and we get so absorbed in the things of life that we sometimes forget that we're citizens of heaven and we're going there and we wonder well how
will God get us to want to go and he sends sickness doesn't he then we get homesick oh there was Abraham he left her the Calvary's remember and he came on over to the land of Canaan into a strange land and again through all the things of life and the trials
that he had he became homesick and we read about Abraham we are told that Abraham he looked for a city which had foundations the real eternal city whose builder and maker is God he got homesick he wanted to go home and when sickness comes to your body
and mine and we know that it's incurable something precious starts doesn't we get homesick we get along for the homeland we get along so the fulfillment of our citizenship I had a birthday last week and of course I missed the card that I usually got
from my sister and when I thought of her again it always came a day late always late with a card or a birthday card but I saw her body waste away just wasting away and draining away and I saw a heavenly homesickness there longing to go home longing to
be with her Lord and you know this thing of sickness it's God's way of telling you and me child I'm getting a bit homesick for you we waited in heaven a long time and now I've sent sickness and soon I'll be calling for you we're anxiously awaiting your
coming we're a bit homesick for you the mansions are ready it's about time to come home that's the advantage of being a citizen of heaven isn't it we can walk the glory road and when the illness takes our bodies we can look up and say that I'm a citizen
of heaven the homeland oh the homeland the land of souls free born no gloomy night is known there but a the paid this morn I'm sighing for that country my heart is aching oh to be at home in the homeland to be there with our Christ that's the fulfillment
of a homesickness God grant that this morning you will write on your soul and I will write on my mind what a lofty position you and I are no less than citizens of heaven the advantage is on our side the peace of God which passeth all human understanding
keep and unite your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus unto life everlasting
