 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Let us hear the Word of God as we find it written in the 16th chapter of St.

John, the 23rd verse.

Barely, barely I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

O Lord our strength and our Redeemer.

Amen.

Good morning dear friends in Christ Jesus, you who are here in God's house, you also friends who are listening by means of the radio.

It is nice, isn't it, being in God's house this morning, and it is nice, radio audience, to have you worshipping with us also this day.

As you know, this is the fifth Sunday after Easter, five weeks since we celebrated the resurrection of our Lord from the dead.

And if you glanced at your church calendar for today, you also saw this Sunday has the name Rogati Sunday.

You may have wondered what that means.

Rogati is a Latin word, it means pray.

It's also called Rogation Sunday, and this Sunday gets that name Rogati because the Gospel lesson for this Sunday, the ancient reading that will have been read today in hundreds of thousands of Christian churches in the world, it contains a tremendous,
a terrific promise of Jesus as regards prayer.

And that text is also the basis of our sermon this morning.

You may say, what is that tremendous, terrific promise that Jesus has made as regards prayer?

This is it.

Jesus has said, barely, barely I say unto you, barely I say to you, Jesus says, in other words, he says, you can base your life on this, you can stake your eternal destiny on this promise as regards prayer.

Barely, truthfully I tell you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father, Jesus says, this is the promise, whatever you ask your Heavenly Father, I don't care what it is, the sky is the limit, I don't care how small your request is or how large your request
is, I don't care how possible your request is or how impossible your request is, whatever, barely nothing, whatever you ask your Heavenly Father, Jesus says, it shall be given you, you will receive that very thing provided you ask your Heavenly
Father in my name, provided you tell him, give it to me, Heavenly Father, because of Jesus, because of him, your Jesus Christi, that you ask it because of me, on account of me, if you will do that, you can stake your life on this promise as regards prayer,
that whatever you ask, the sky is the limit, you will get exactly what you ask, if you will just ask it because of me in my name.

You and I may say today on Rogati Sunday, that's a tremendous, terrific promise if there ever was one.

We may say it's almost too good to be true, and we may say to ourselves, does Christ mean to say that I can stake my life on that, that I can believe that with my whole heart, that regardless of what happens, that I need never disavow that promise, that
whatever, regardless of what it is that I ask, that I'm going to get it, if I ask it because of him, on behalf of his name, because of his worthiness, and we may say to ourselves, that's hard to believe that I can hold that through thick and thin, because
we may say, where is there any connection between asking it because of Jesus and the Father's willingness to give me anything that I ask for?

We may say I failed to see a connection.

We may say to ourselves, is the name of Jesus so tremendous, is it so wonderful, that it does move God, that when I ask God anything, that God says, I'll give it to you if you ask it in the name of Jesus, because of Jesus, on his behalf, is it possible that
God the Father is obligated to Jesus, that he must give me everything I ask for when I ask it in the name of Jesus?

And you and I ought to know this today, that when Jesus says you can stake your life on this, I tell you that barring nothing, the sky is the limit, whatever you ask the Father, you will receive if you ask it in my name, and all because of this, God the
Father is hopelessly and gloriously obligated to Jesus.

He is eternally obligated.

He owes Jesus such a death.

He is absolutely indebted to him to such a point that it's the joy of our Father's existence to give you and me everything that we ask.

You may say this morning, you say preacher, that Jesus, what he has done has made the Father so gloriously obligated to him that God can do nothing less than when we ask God for anything in the name of Jesus that God will give it to us, that God is that
obligated to Jesus of Nazareth.

That's right.

You may say, what did Jesus ever do?

The sphanger of Galilee to obligate God our Father to such an extent, so gloriously obligating him, so gloriously making God feel that he owes Jesus this, that whenever you and I call in prayer, that whatever it is, even though the sky is the limit,
that we'll get what we ask for because we ask it on the basis of Jesus' name.

Why Jesus has done that which has made God the Father his debtor eternally and gloriously.

You may say, what has he done?

Well in the first place, let's know this, that Jesus has paid in full to the Heavenly Father for our salvation.

You talk about Jesus of Nazareth putting the Father under obligation to him.

Let's bear in mind, oh yes, Jesus of Nazareth was God's Son, but look what he did for us and he paid in full for your salvation and mine to the Heavenly Father.

He was God's Son to be sure that came out of the ivory palace as he became a human being and he went to the cross and what did he do at Calvary?

When you and I begin to understand the cross, then we say this to ourselves, that he paid in full for our salvation.

He took to himself your guilt and mine and your punishment and mine, not only for our birth sin, our original sin, but he took the guilt and punishment for every thought, word, and deed that you and I will ever do in our lives.

And he took the guilt and punishment not only for you and me, but for all men of all generations of all time and on the cross he paid in full for your release and mine from eternal damnation and eternal health.

He died on the cross and bore in his own body the equal of an eternity in hell for you and me and paid in full for our salvation.

He rescued you and me from sin.

He rescued you and me from eternal consequences of sin.

He rescued you and me for the safety of heaven and in that sacrifice he obligated God the Father tremendously to him because Jesus bore a 100% righteousness.

All righteousness that you and I need for forgiveness for life and salvation and because God the Father is so obligated and under obligation to Jesus, therefore Christ says to you and me today you can't stake your life on this promise that when
you ask the Father whatever you ask him you're going to get it because if you ask it in Jesus name God the Father is so obligated to Christ that it's the delight of his existence on the basis of Jesus to grant you and me every spiritual blessing that
we ask for.

Bringing it down in your life and mine what does this mean?

It means this friend that whenever you and I turn to our Heavenly Father and we say Heavenly Father forgive me my sins take away my guilt and my punishment in the name of Jesus or because of Jesus God the Father says to you and me because you have asked
me to do it in the name of Jesus because of him and because I am so gloriously obligated to him that he came in full for your redemption there is nothing I would rather do therefore I pardon your sins I wash your soul whiter than snow though your sins
be as scarlet they shall be whiter than snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool and God says I delight that's the joy of my existence to give you every spiritual blessing that you ask me for when you ask it because of Jesus because
Jesus paid me in full and if I would fail therefore to give you every blessing when you ask it in his name I would cease to be God.

Oh the joy that means that you and I can stand before Christ and say I know that I'm a sinner but on the basis of Jesus Heavenly Father deliver me from the eternal punishment of my sins give me the assurance of eternal life and it's the delight of your
Heavenly Father in mind to say it because you've asked it in the name of Jesus because you've asked me to do it because of him and I am so eternally obligated to him it is the joy of my existence to grant you eternal life and everlasting salvation you
and I can come to the Heavenly Father doesn't matter how great a blessing we ask spiritually speaking we can say God as in the Lord's Prayer give me the strength that I may keep your name holy in my life that I may live that men may know that you're a holy
God and God for Jesus sakes is I glad to give you that spiritual strength and you and I can say God give me the courage that I can speak to others about the kingdom of Jesus that others may be brought into the kingdom and for Christ's sake God gives you
and me that courage he again gives you and me the courage when we ask him that we might do his will on earth as the angels do it in heaven that we might have strength and spiritual stability and God delights when we say give it to me because of Jesus since
Jesus paid the debt in full to the Heavenly Father it's the joy of his life to grant you and me that strength we prayed only does not into temptation and God says I'll give you every strength that no temptation shall ever be great enough to cause you
to lose Christ in eternal life I give you that strength for Jesus sake and we say deliver me from the evil one and God delivers you and me from the evil one from Satan for the simple reason that again he gives you and me every spiritual blessing when
we say for Jesus sake because of Jesus on his account and he does it because he is so gloriously obligated to Jesus and on this prayer Sunday then we ought to say to ourselves beginning today I am going to believe with all my heart and I'm going to stick
my life on this promise that whatever I ask in prayer that it matters not what it is whatever I ask my Heavenly Father the sky is the limit regardless of how great or how small the request regardless of how impossible or possible it may seem I know that
God the Father is going to give me that when I say because of Jesus in his name God is hopelessly eternally gloriously indebted and obligated to Jesus and therefore it's the glory of his existence to grant you and me when we ask in the name of Jesus
everything that we ask for that ought to mean this in your life and mind this morning that we ought to be determined never to pray a prayer without the name of Jesus and then never to hesitate to go to our Heavenly Father regardless of how great our
sins may be what about this thing of praying in Jesus name well sometimes we we think that those are just words that we say a magical formula but oh they are tremendous in the Lord's prayer they do not occur and therefore we know this we ought never
to pray a prayer without saying in Jesus name or because of Jesus or implying it we don't have to mention the words but again we must ever pray in that spirit that we are approaching the Heavenly Father because of Jesus for this reason to deliberately
leave out the name of Jesus because some men may want us to do it that means to leave out the name of him who has opened up the way to the Heavenly Father there is no prayer heard by God the Father except it comes in the name of Jesus and in his spirit when
you and I deliberately cast out the name of Christ no man comes therefore to the throne of grace because no man comes to the Father except through Jesus Christ if you and I are in a group where the name of Jesus is not recognized and we are asked to leave
his name out we're in the wrong group because to leave out the name of Jesus deliberately means this that God doesn't hear when we call and he doesn't answer but oh when you and I know that we can stick our lives that God will give us anything that we
ask for if we ask it because of Jesus then why should we ever hesitate even though our sin looks so great not long ago I met a woman and she opened up her heart to me and she said this that all of our lives she has simply been plagued by the fact that the first
child after she was married came rather early and people counted on their fingers and she seemed so disgraced by it and it seemed to again given her life just simply a sense of feeling that God wouldn't have anything to do with her and I said don't
you realize this that God the Father will grant you every spiritual blessing when you ask it because of Jesus Jesus died for that sin too he died for any sin that may gnaw at your conscience and mine and at our soul and I said if you'd ask God heavenly
father forgive me that sin because of Jesus immediately God the Father says I brought it out of my mind forever I remember your sin no more though your sin be as scarlet it shall be whiter than snow though it be red like crimson it shall be as wool the
delight of God even though your sin in mine may seem tremendous when we ask the heavenly father forgive me because of Jesus there is no greater delight God would rather do it than eat to forgive and to forget and to bring you and me that peace that Jesus
speaks about that our joy may be full to know that God because of Jesus he always hears and answers regardless of what it is that we have asked for that's the assurance and the comfort that we have on Rogati Sunday Jesus says barely barely I say until
you can stake your life on this we may say to ourselves when Jesus says today the living Christ through his word you can stake your life on this or whatever you ask I don't care the sky is the limit regardless of how impossible or possible maybe whatever
you ask the father you are going to get it if you will just ask it because of Jesus on his account in his name you and I may say is God the father so obligated to Jesus that he must give me what I ask for when I say for Jesus sake and because of Jesus and the
truth is that God is hopelessly obligated to Jesus of Nazareth God the father is gloriously obligated oh again he is so indebted to Jesus for what Jesus has done that it's the joy of his existence that whatever you and I ask in the name of Jesus God
wants to give it and God does give it you may say well how does it come that God is so indebted to Jesus not only because of this that Jesus paid the father in full for our salvation but in the second place let's know this that Jesus he fulfilled the will
of God perfectly and gladly for us you know there are those that say God would grant us anything oh God could never do that because he forced his son to the cross there are those that say you preachers with your slaughterhouse religion you've got
a blood religion you've got a God the father who forced his son to the cross and because he forced him therefore to die for our sins it's nothing but a blood religion it's horrible it's stomach turning but may you and I realize this Jesus didn't go
to the cross because he was forced to go when you and I go back to the garden of Gethsemane he prayed what did he say he said again oh the cross was looming there was again his death and he was to bearing his body the sins of the world it was a tremendous
load that you and I can never even fathom but he prayed oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me but then he said not my will but thy will be done he gladly and willingly fulfilled the will of his heavenly father he wasn't forced to the cross
and because Jesus went to the cross gladly because he went voluntarily because he went willingly and because he perfectly fulfilled the will of God when he died for your sins and mine on the cross therefore let's know this God is hopelessly obligated
to Jesus God owes Jesus a debt of gratitude that forces God joyously and rejoicingly when you and I call upon him in prayer to give us everything that we ask because Jesus has fulfilled so perfectly and gladly the will of God for us therefore when
you and I call upon God the father whatever we ask for in the name of Jesus we get you may say now wait a minute preacher I've asked for a lot of things in my life and I prayed in the name of Jesus and I've asked God the father on bended knee to grant me some
earthly blessings and I ask it in the name of Jesus and because of him and you may say to me I never got him you may say there was illness that came to me and I prayed to God the heavenly father to give me health and I asked it for the sake of Jesus but I didn't
get help you may say in my home there was a loved one that I prayed for to the heavenly father and I asked that God might spare his life and I prayed because of Jesus and that person died you may say preacher how can you say that whatever I ask if I ask it
in the name of Jesus because of Jesus that I'm going to get it may I say to you friend you still got what you asked for didn't you as a Christian you and I have the right to tell God what our will is in any matter and it's true whenever a loved one is ill your
will and mine is always that they might live isn't that right but as a Christian we say this to ourselves that's my will but do you know whether your will and mine is the best and when we tell God what our will is and we pray in the name of Jesus aren't we
saying to God God the reason I want my will is because I think it's best but aren't we also saying God if my will isn't the best I don't want you to sin and do something second best I don't want you to do something that would be wrong I still want you to do
your will because your will is always best it's always right it's always the finest isn't that the way you and I pray and on that basis that's what Jesus mean whatsoever you ask with earthly things regardless of what you and I ask the Heavenly Father
we're going to get it because God is so obligated to Jesus who has fulfilled his will that God says when you say God give me this because of Jesus God said I promise you my will will be done and my will is best God never fails does he you see you and I may
sometimes send your God and we may say God didn't hear my prayer even though I asked it because of Jesus so didn't he you know when you go in to see a picture and you happen to hit it in the middle you and I may say it doesn't make head or tails doesn't because
you haven't seen the end and God says this to you and me and Christ says you can't stake your life on this that when you get to the end of your life then you will understand and know that what God did was best God always gives us what we ask because as Christians
whether we realize it or not we are asking God to do what is best that we've always got and at the end of life when you and I look back one of the joys of gratitude will this it will say to our Heavenly Father at the time I didn't realize that when I expressed
my will to you and I wondered whether yours was better than mine but now I see it as I look back your will was best Jesus says you can stake your life on this promise Jesus says you can put all your faith and trust that whatever you ask the Father you're
going to get and all because you ask it in the name of Jesus because of him oh God is so hopelessly and delightfully obligated to Jesus that it's the joy of his existence when we ask God for anything because of Jesus that God says oh that's the joy of
my life to give you everything you ask for and when God's will is done in your life and mine that's everything that you and I have asked for isn't that true therefore we ought to say to ourselves on this Rogati Sunday on prayer Sunday I'm going to believe
this statement of Jesus it's tremendous I am going to stake my life on this that whenever I call upon God my Father whatever I ask him I don't care how small or how great or how possible or impossible it may be that I know this and when I say give it to me
God in the name of Jesus because of Jesus that you and I must have this conviction that God will give it regardless of what you and I may ask and then we'll see to it that in every prayer we'll either say it or we will always imply that we'll ask it for Jesus
sake and will not hesitate regardless of how hopeless your situation and mine may appear sometimes your life and mine with adversity looks rather hopeless doesn't it and we say oh God can't do anything but Jesus says barely barely I say unto you
whatsoever anything that you ask the Father if you just ask for it in my name you'll get it the day of the miracle isn't over you and I may say they're miracles but to God it's simply the use of the omnipotence the power and the wisdom that he has when
life to you and me in your home and mind when adversity comes and it seems so hopeless there is no reason to give up hope Jesus says believe this with all your heart you ask the heavenly Father and whatever you ask it's going to be done if you ask it in
the name of Jesus how many of us are alive because we turn to a God of omnipotence in the name of Jesus and it was his will that means this peace of mind and this joyous comfort that you and I are immortal it matters not what may come we are the mortal death
will never touch us until we have completed our mission in life that's peace of mind that comes through prayer that comes when you and I can believe Jesus when he says barely barely I say unto you that we can stake our lives on it oh on prayer Sunday
the tremendous promise of Jesus it's breathtaking isn't it that Christ says you can believe this with all your heart I don't care what you ask my heavenly Father the sky's the limit how great or how small or how impossible or how possible it may be
whatever you ask you're going to get it if you will just say give it to me because of Jesus give it to me because of his name give it to me on his behalf and all because why God the Father is so obligated so in debt to Jesus of Nazareth that if God on the basis
of him wouldn't give you and me everything that we asked him for God would cease to be God it's the delight of his life you say you mean to tell me that Jesus of Nazareth has obligated God the Father to him oh gloriously so not only this that he paid in
full for our salvation not only this that Jesus kept perfectly and gladly the will of God for us but also this that's why God the Father is eternally obligated to Jesus Jesus is the one who has given value to all of the old testament sacrifices that
God ordained and God commanded you may say what do you mean by that preacher whichever you say well here if God again will hear us and answer us and give us everything we want only if we pray in the name of Jesus how about those in the old testament before
Jesus came into the world how about those individuals you know Jesus said to his disciples he said I've been speaking to you in veiled sayings and he said you haven't asked anything in my name so far but you will because now I'm explaining things
how many of us realize that no prayer except in the name of Jesus ever reaches the throne of grace and in the old testament the reason why the prayers of God's children reached the throne of grace was because of Jesus Christ you may say where is there
any value in the old testament sacrificial system of offering up a lamb or a goat in the shedding of animal blood you may say animal blood can't bring about the forgiveness of sins and you are so right but bear in mind that every sacrificial sacrifice
in the old testament every lamb that was slaughtered every goat that was slaughtered pointed to the lamb of God pointed to Jesus who would come into the world and therefore when in the old testament they offered up lambs and goats they did it what
in the name of the lamb of God the messiah that would come and therefore Jesus when he came he gave value to every sacrifice that in the old testament whether they realized it or not they received from God the father everything that they asked for
because their prayers were asked in the name and for the sake of Jesus Christ Jesus obligated the father tremendously by giving value to all of the sacrifices and therefore let's know this that God the father is so gloriously indebted to the son
that it's the joy of his existence when you and I call upon him and we ask whatever we ask for the sake of Jesus that he gives it to us because this has always been true since the beginning of time go back into the old to how does it come that David with his
horrible sins got forgiveness when he turned to the heavenly father why because it was in the name of Jesus the messiah who would come into the world why is it that when Daniel was in the lion's den he was protected because Daniel prayed because Daniel
prayed in the life of the messiah that was to come how about the three men and the fiery furnace shadrach nishak and the bed and they go there again it was because they prayed and in the name again of the messiah that would come in the name of Christ God
challenges you and me you name one instant in the word of God where God ever failed when men called upon him in the name of Jesus or because of the messiah when God didn't fulfill this promise that he gave them what they asked for the finest and the best
that promise stands secure unbroken invincible that's why today yes in this hour we ought to say to ourselves I'm going to believe this and stake my life on it that prayer has power that prayer does something that when I turn to the heavenly father
that I will get everything that I ask for parting nothing as long as I ask it in the name of Jesus and because of Jesus and if you and I will believe that then today in this hour we will turn to the heavenly father we will ask him for strength to remain true
to Jesus Christ in this dark hour in world history well I know that every generation looks at its world and it says these are the days which try men's souls but the other night I took the front page of the marion star then I took the front page of the Columbus
dispatch and I just read the headlines and again when you do that it's not only shocking but it's a fearsome thing you and I say when has the world ever been in the fix that it's in today when has our country ever been so shaky and so rocky as it is today
when we go to put our finger on it we say why is this dark hour isn't it this that somehow or other we have lost respect and honor for God and for authority each one is going to live for himself we want to be our own God we want to do as we please we're going
to get what we want and we're going to get it regardless of any kind of scruples and you may say to me well what is the answer what is the answer I think of Jesus I walked the we of the La Rosa in Jerusalem one day I went up David's feet going to Calvary and
I remember as I walked that road Jesus carried his cross up the Via Dolores and remember when the women cried and they were feeling sorry for him and he turned to them and he said women he says weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
because the days are coming when you shall say to the mountains fall upon us into the hills cover us up and those days came didn't they in the year 70 when Titus and Vespasian surrounded the city of Jerusalem and not one stone was left upon another
I wonder if in this hour when we are coming apart and in darkness I wonder whether Jesus isn't saying to America don't weep for me but you'd better start weeping for yourselves and for your children the days are going to come when you're going to play
to the mountains to fall on you into the hills to cover you you may say isn't that a pessimistic view I know of no other answer for this hour than Jesus Christ but I also know that there are a hundred million Americans in this country that have no use
for him and don't intend to have any use for him I know that but I don't look for any wholesale conversion we are turning away church attendance is dropping men are turning away from Jesus Christ it's no longer popular to go to church yet I've had men
say to me if you had your ministry to do over again what would you do differently as regards peace and may I say before God and man I wouldn't change it a bit I have stood in God's pulpit and I have declared the council of God the glorious blessing that
in Christ men's hearts are changed and only in Christ and only as you change men's hearts do you change men's lives and do you change nations and do you change the world today again we stand and we say to ourselves can you believe with all your heart
that when you call upon God because of Jesus that there will be strength that you and I can bear what sinly is coming God knows what is coming it doesn't look good does it but oh he promises this through prayer God says I'll give you what you ask for that
we can have strength that if the day comes that all that you've got left and all that I've got left is Jesus Christ we can say we are still more than conquerors to him that loved us I stood in Rome one day on the Appian Way and I walked down the Appian Way
and I thought of an incident of tradition tells us that happened on the Appian Way one night it was the Apostle Peter he was in Rome the tradition says that when again the Neronian persecution broke out and they were killing Christians and throwing
them in the Colosseum to the lions that Peter began to flee the city of Rome he was going down the Appian Way going to save his life because he was afraid and in the darkness he was walking down the Appian Way and there was a figure coming towards him
on the Appian Road and as the figure approached him old Pete Johnson looked and he recognized that face and it was the face of the living Christ when he saw Jesus we are told that he said full bodies Dominique where are you going master and it is said
that Jesus looked at Pete Johnson and he said I'm going to Rome to be crucified again then Pete Johnson in weakness he prayed for strength that he might have a faith that would hold on he turned around went back the Appian Way and went back to Rome there
he was crucified and when they were ready to nail him to the cross it is said that Peter said my Lord was nailed to the cross with his head up I'm not worthy of that crucifying he but put my head down and tradition says that old Pete Johnson the old war
horse was crucified upside down he asked for strength when nothing else was left he still had Christ I don't know what's coming but thank God for the assurance in prayer Jesus says you can stake your life on this that if you ask the father for strength
to keep you in Jesus Christ regardless of what comes if you lose everything know this if you ask it because of my name you're mighty sure to get it and then you and I can say as the Apostle for I am persuaded that neither life nor death nor angels nor principalities
nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus that's prayer that's its power oh to God that you and I would have that assurance
of it and walk the glory road and think that in this hour but we we've got something sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer that calls me from a world of care that bids me at my father's throne make all my wants and wishes known in seasons of distress
and grief my soul has often found relief and off the skate the tempter's snare by thy return sweet hour of prayer Jesus says you can stake your life on this whatever regardless of what it is you ask my father he will give it to you if you just say in Jesus
name because of Jesus dor-e-ism christy amen the peace of God which passeth all human understanding keep and unite your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus until life everlasting
