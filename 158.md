## Synopsis
Words of praise from the sons of Emanuel congregation.

## Transcript
We have received a telegram from Albert E. Anderson, General Manager of the Augsburg Publishing House, and I would like to read that telegram at this time.

The Division of Publications of the American Lutheran Church joins your congregation in congratulating your pastor, Dr. Martin E. Hollensen, as you celebrate the 40th anniversary of his ordination.

Pastor Hollensen has given distinguished service to the entire church on the Board of Publications.

We are grateful for his efforts.

May the Lord of all of us continue to bless Pastor Hollensen and Mrs. Hollensen and your congregation in the years to come, Albert E. Anderson.

At this time, I would like to call Dr. Hollensen and Carlton Case to please come to the stand.

I'm afraid someone moved the plaque.

##### 01:23

They feel about the way I felt one time when I preached on stewardship, you remember, and the deacons went for the offering plates and they weren't there.

Professor Hollensen, again, as a spokesman for Emanuel congregation on this memorable day, it's my privilege to present to you this framed scroll which was prepared by an artist as a token of our love and affection.

##### 02:00

It's a small token indeed, but nonetheless, it is certainly shared by every member of Emanuel as well as the thousands of people in this community.

I will read it.

November the 14th, 1971.

Reverend Hollensen, this is a letter of recognition, of gratitude, and of congratulations as 1971 greets you with several notable anniversaries.

Words alone will not serve our purpose.

It will take the warmth of hands that clasp yours on this occasion and a tangible remembrance from all of us to help convey our feelings.

The American Lutheran Church, the Ohio District, the manual congregation, and each of us individually are in your depth.

##### 03:02

Seldom has one person walked so many extra miles in dedicated service to God and man, may you continue to walk with us and for us in the years to come, secure in the knowledge that you are wanted and appreciated by a grateful congregation on behalf of Emanuel, the vestry.

Now you'll have to bear with us a little bit, Reverend.

We were going to give you this.

This is the third time we've offered this to the minister today.

But you bear with us for two more hours.

This will be on an easel in the basement for you people to appreciate the artwork.

This was done by the Mace Company, one of their artists who I understand is a member of our church.

And now one more thing.

There was one statement here.

##### 04:00

I realize Reverend was rather nervous this morning and he probably didn't pick this up.

It said, and on this occasion and a tangible remembrance.

You probably didn't hear that.

But I have something else here.

This is more the tangible remembrance that we refer to.

In appreciation of your dedicated service to us of Emanuel Lutheran Church over these past 34 years, the vestry has voted unanimously on behalf of the entire congregation to provide you and your wife Ruth a home.

You may occupy this at the time you select for your retirement from active ministry in the church to which you were called so many years ago.

##### 05:02

This home may be of your own choosing.

And if a satisfactory one that is already constructed cannot be located, then the vestry intends that one shall be built upon a satisfactory site.

It is felt that the value of this home should be in the range of $35,000 to $40,000, depending upon the market at that time.

This property would be transferred to you on a life estate basis for your use, as long as either of you shall live.

It is our hope and prayer that the Lord will continue to bestow upon you the blessing of good health.

Also, that you will be moved to serve us at Emanuel for many additional years.

We at Emanuel, as well as thousands of others whose lives you have touched, are indeed indebted to you for your untiring and conscientious efforts in our behalf.

##### 06:10

We highly invite you to continue with us for as long as you desire.

We do want you, however, to feel free to follow your inclination as to the time when you may wish to retire.

We extend our very best wishes to you folks of the parsonage family on this joyful occasion, yours in Christ, Emanuel Congregation.

And our best wishes go to you, Pastor.

I have a lot to say, but I don't know that I can say it.

I suppose I don't have to tell you this is one of the greatest surprises of my life.

##### 07:00

I never thought of such a thing.

You have provided a parsonage for us for 34 years.

We've lived alongside of the church.

I have always lived alongside of the church in both of the pastorates that I have filled, first at Grace Church at Eaton and at Marion.

I don't know how it is to live away from the church.

Being close to the church, it means a great deal.

I have enjoyed it.

I wondered when retirement time would come.

We didn't worry about it because God has always provided what we would do.

I will say that Ruth and I have talked it over a number of times, and we have said, well, we can't hardly leave Marion if the time of retirement comes because here are our friends.

And I can assure you after being with you for 34 years as of today, it would be a very terrific and tragic experience for us to uproot and to leave you.

##### 08:09

We hope to stay in Marion.

What we would do when we would move out of the parsonage, I thought, well, God will provide.

And may I thank you so very much.

You surely don't owe that to us to provide a home for us, that it will be our temporary home when we leave Marion and go to our home in heaven.

Thank you so much.

I told him to hold me up if I fouled up, so I'm going to put him close to me.

I'll hold him up.

During the tenure of Dr. Hollensen here at Emanuel, a number of young men have gone into the ministry under certainly the inspiration of Dr. Hollensen.

And at this time, I would like to ask those present.

I believe there were 12, and we have one in the seminary who has graduated, I think, at this time.

##### 09:00

A number of them have not been able to attend, but those that are here, I'd like to have you come up, if you will, please.

Those of you, the sons who have attended, who are here, please come up and line up here on the platform.

Will you do that, please?

At this time, I'd like to have each of you gentlemen, if you would so desire, to come up and make a statement one at a time.

That's for the time that you were in the ministry and the church you are now serving, if you will, please.

##### 10:01

John's name was first, but I'll get going.

I don't know how long we're supposed to speak, but you make an mistake there by not telling us.

Not too long.

I suppose the most remarkable thing about, I remember about, Pastor Hollensen is his enthusiasm.

I'm a man of very few talents, and probably lowest on the totem pole.

And I suppose that the thing, in fact, shows you how low they are.

This past year, the Ohio district was looking to, they were trying to put me on a parish aid committee, and they couldn't think of too much to say about me, and so they said, Pastor Kennel is very enthusiastic, and he has three children.

I haven't figured that out yet, but that's practical.

And to show that he has to be enthusiastic, when I came to him back in whatever year it was, and told him that I would like to go into the ministry, he had to be enthusiastic to stay there with a straight face.

##### 11:06

He just had to.

I'm serving St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New Lebanon, Ohio, which is down near Dayton, and we're close to where Pastor Hollensen began his ministry.

Eaton is only about 10 miles away.

So we have a lot of people down there that are quite close to Pastor Hollensen, and we've just kept some warm relationships down there.

Just tickled to be here, Paul.

I'm John Gast.

Jim Kennel and I were ordained at the same time with Tom Rio.

I'm also Mrs. Alfreda Gast's little boy, Johnny, and I'm serving a church close to Sydney Island.

I'm the next to the last one on the list.

My name is Denny Hacker, and I'm up in Bradner, Ohio.

##### 12:03

Since no one knows where that is, it's near Toledo.

I didn't realize it until I was sitting here today, but an awful lot of your sermons frightened me when I sat up there in that choir.

And I don't mean that in the wrong sense.

I really think that that was a good feeling, and it did something to me.

So I'm glad to be here.

I'm Dick Williams.

I'm serving St. Andrew Lutheran Church at Enon, Ohio, which is between Springfield and Dayton.

I've been in the ministry six years.

I suppose that in my own ministry there's probably not a day that goes by, but what I, in one way or another, think of Reverend Hollensen, and remember that I owe a great deal to him in my ministry.

##### 13:04

As you all well know, he's a great preacher, and we live in a time when preaching is kind of suspect, and I guess if you want to talk about the rules of communication, I think the sermon violates about every rule there is.

It's good, though, to have him kind of in the background these days, because I know that in him we see someone who shows us that preaching is still something worthwhile, and it's a way of moving people and inspiring them.

I had an opportunity back in the spring to hear a tape of a sermon that he had given.

This is a baccalaureate sermon here at Emanuel for this year's graduating class, and those of you who heard it will certainly agree with me that that was a powerful sermon.

It certainly moved and inspired me, even though there have been several years since I graduated from high school or anything, anyplace else.

##### 14:06

He's a great preacher, as you well know, and I'm grateful to him for the example and the inspiration that he's provided in that and in every other area of the ministry.

To many here at Emanuel, I'm known as Jack Kerr.

In the program it says John Kerr.

When I left Marion, I took up my baptized name of John Kerr and got rid of Jack, and then last Sunday I was at a dedication service and I was walking up the sidewalk and someone yelled out, Hi, Jack! And I turned around and noticed I thought it was somebody from Emanuel, but it wasn't.

It was somebody that knew my name and I don't know how they found out about it, but lived in Groveport.

I was ordained with Dick as well as with Jack Max.

I'm the three of us together in 1965.

##### 15:03

And Pastor Hollensen, on this day, I'm thanking God that the Holy Spirit has used you in such a dynamic and a powerful way.

Jack already introduced me.

I guess I'm the last of the three bandits.

We're together on that day some six years ago, it only seems yesterday.

I serve Lord of Life Lutheran Church in Chagrin Falls, which is southeast of Cleveland.

We were in Illinois for five years and then had a chance to come back to the home state.

And we're glad to be here today.

We were late, as you saw, running up the aisle.

We had a little drive before we could get here.

I guess when you think about a man who's influenced your life and you wonder in this day and age, what does it mean, a successful ministry, how do you measure a man?

##### 16:07

His stature in the church and as a son of God and as a pastor.

I guess rather than numbers and statistics, you measure him by the influence that God has been able to use him and as he's been blessed to be a blessing to others.

And I think that speaks for itself.

Thank you very much gentlemen.

Certainly happy to have you with us.

You may be seated at this time.

There are other young men who are not able to attend.

Spiritual sons other than the ones we have heard are Renix Van Scoy, John Dennis, Tom Reel, Charles Gerlich, Peter Zieg, and Fred Reel.

##### 17:05

Some of them have responded with letters.

I have them before me and I would like to take the time to read them if I may.

From Fred Reel he writes, however inadequate this letter is, I do extend my hearty congratulations to you.

You certainly have been a leader in serving God in this world and no one could deserve a day of celebration and honor for this service like you do.

You have helped innumerable people in your career.

I would like to especially extend my thanks to you for the inspiration and help you have offered me in my difficult times of decision.

Sometimes I wonder where I might be now if it had not been for your help and inspiration.

Also I cannot overlook the financial help we have received from the congregation.

I really doubt that I would be where I am today in my studies without your help in this respect.

Thanks Reverend Hollensen and thanks Emanuel Congregation.

Best wishes to you Reverend Hollensen that your ministry may continue as long as you may wish for it to continue.

##### 18:00

May you continue to be uplifted as you have uplifted.

Others, Fred Reel.

The Reverend Rennix Van Scoy.

Please do convey the congratulations and finest hopes to Reverend and Mrs. Hollensen and the members of Emanuel from the Van Scoys.

With such a combination of observances of their wedding and his ordination milestones plus a birthday party, it can't help but be big.

It is one of the outstanding ministries in our entire church and has served as an inspiration to every one of Emanuel's spiritual sons as well as to so many others.

God has blessed Emanuel and the Hollensens all the way.

I am on a three year extended ministry serving as development director for the building of a new St. Luke's hospital in Toledo.

We hope to dedicate and open the doors of this new Lutheran sponsored health facility next October.

It is now about 55% complete.

Following my graduation from seminary in Columbus, I was ordained at Emanuel on June 6, 1943.

##### 19:00

Have a wonderful B-Day and the very best to all of you.

For the William & Shirley Rennix Van Scoy.

From Peter Zigg, he also sent letters since I won't be able to be there in person, perhaps you could convey my greetings as follows.

Reverend Hollensen, you and your wife are certainly in our thoughts and prayers this day as you celebrate your wedding and ordination anniversary and that milestone birthday.

Though we could not join the celebration this day, we give thanks to God for you and your ministry in Marion.

The help he has given you and our personal acquaintance who has led us to this ministry in Baltimore.

Have a happy day, Judy, Mark and I wish we could have been there with you today.

Pete Zigg graduated in 1969.

From the Reverend John Dennis, should you care to read this in my absence, I have this to say.

I was in his second confirmation class June 4, 1939.

##### 20:02

That is the second one held in the Marion congregation.

I was graduated from Capital University in 1946 and from our seminary in 1950.

I was then ordained on June 18, 1950 and have served this Rutherford congregation since then.

Much of my inspiration and teaching can well be followed back to both Pastor Schillinger and Hollensen.

I thank God daily for both of these men of God.

May the Lord of the church bless our pastor that he may go forward in strength and faith and hope from this day forward even as he has gone on these past 40 years.

Again, I regret my not being able to be present, but Sunday is, as one has well said, the pastor's Labor Day.

P.S. Take good care of our pastor. Pray for him and spare him all the attention that you can because you will never get another one like him. I have never met one like him and I have looked, believe me. Signed in Christ, John Dennis.

##### 21:05

From Tom Reel as follows.

It would indeed be a thrill to be present and to come forward with the other young men who are spiritual sons of Emanuel Lutheran Church.

I would like to give witness to the appreciation and admiration which I have for Pastor Hollensen and for the tremendous inspiration and guidance which he has given to me for many, many years.

I thank God for having blessed him with so many years of good health and for having blessed us with his powerful ministry of the Gospel and dynamic leadership.

If I were with you in person, I would relate that I graduated from Capital University in 1956 and from the seminary in Columbus in 1960.

I was ordained into the Christian ministry at Emanuel Lutheran Church on June 19, 1960.

I then served as pastor of congregations of the American Lutheran Church for nearly 10 years.

At the present time, I am not serving as pastor of a congregation, but I'm working with delinquent boys in a black ghetto on the west side of Chicago.

##### 22:03

As a juvenile parole counselor, I seek to communicate the love of Christ to these often forgotten youth.

Please communicate to Pastor Hollensen the joy and gratitude which I feel on this big day, even though I cannot be present in person.

I praise God because he has sent a prophet to stand among us to reveal to us the love of Jesus Christ.

I thank Pastor Hollensen for having shared that Gospel so faithfully with me throughout these many years, your brother in Christ, Tom Leo.

We also had asked Dr. Paul Molnar to be here, and he was unable to be here at this time.

But in his absence, he did record his words on tape, and he has sent that tape to us, and I would like to have Joe Peters play that tape at this time.

Dr. Martin Hollensen, it is a pleasure to be able to greet you via this tape.

##### 23:02

On the occasion of your 65th birthday, the 40th anniversary of your ordination, and the 40th anniversary of your wedding, what an event to celebrate all on one day.

We're so happy that the fact of your 65th birthday does not mean that you are terminating your services to the Emanuel Church of Marion, the High District, the Board of Publications, or the American Lutheran Church.

Your ministry has been most effective and most blessed.

##### 24:03

We look upon you as the number one pastor of the number one church of our district.

We marvel every time we think of the workload that you are carrying.

We sometimes think of the trend today where a church of your size would require the services of three or four pastors.

And then we see you carrying on this work almost totally alone.

What an evidence this is of the blessing which God has bestowed upon you in good health, good spirit, and real dedication.

I'm sure that in these 40 years of married life, there have been many times when your wife and family may have wondered where you were, what you were doing, and why you didn't spend more time with them.

##### 25:19

But it wouldn't have taken much by way of reflection to remind them very forcibly that in your life, you have dedicated it to the Lord's service, and that for the most part, He and His service always had priority.

When you celebrated your 35th anniversary, it was our privilege to talk to you about the romance of the ministry.

I'm sure that in your life, your work in the church has been a real romance based on love, fulfilled in love, and rendered in love.

##### 26:17

So we greet you.

We thank God for you on every remembrance of you.

And we pray that His blessing and mercy may continue with you in the days that are ahead.

It's always good to see you when you come to some of our gatherings.

It's good to know you as a friend, as a coworker, and best of all, as a dedicated man of God.

Dr. Hollensen, in behalf of the members of the Emanuel Congregation, and also in behalf of the vestry of the Emanuel Lutheran Church, and also speaking for myself, I would like to congratulate you on your 65th birthday.

##### 27:05

God has certainly blessed you with immeasurable health, which I'm sure you are certainly grateful to God for that health.

I would also like to congratulate you on your 40th wedding anniversary.

Perhaps I should congratulate your wife Ruth for putting up with you for so many years.

But that marriage also has been blessed with children.

God has blessed you with children, with grandchildren.

And probably as time flies, not too long, some great-grandchildren will come along.

But again, we congratulate you on that, and we certainly want to congratulate you on your 40th ordination into the ministry, 34 years of which have been at Emanuel Lutheran Church.

It says in the Bible, which I'm sure we all are aware of, that thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his hire.

But you know, some people don't know that it also says in that very same chapter as Paul is speaking to Timothy, that it says that the elder or the minister who is faithful in word and doctrine should be considered for double honor.

##### 28:11

And I am hopeful, Reverend Hollensen, that over the years that you have served this congregation, the years that will certainly come in which we hope that you will continue to serve this congregation, and the things that have gone on here that you certainly have received from God, that double honor.

And as I say, we appreciate the years that you have given to us of this congregation, and the blessings that have been bestowed upon all of us through your ministry, and we are hopeful that you will see fit to continue to serve this congregation for many years to come.

May God richly bless you as you continue to work in his kingdom.

God bless you, Doctor.

I'd just like to say a few more words, getting a little more collected.

First of all, you have no idea what a thrill it is to hear these boys get up and to speak as ministers of Jesus Christ.

##### 29:01

I like to think of the twelve sons that have gone out as the jewels of Emanuel.

I like to feel on Sunday morning when I am in the pulpit that there are twelve of our sons occupying pulpits somewhere, preaching the good news about Jesus Christ.

I would like to also at this time mention Pastor Basler, who was the first son in the congregation to go into the ministry.

And as you know, we have Fred Veal, who was finishing his last year at our seminary in Columbus.

He will be ordained into the ministry sometime this coming June.

As a pastor, I don't think there is a greater joy that comes than seeing the son of the congregation go into the ministry.

It has been one of the joys of my life.

Here as pastor at Emanuel, I hope that in the years that God gives me, that there will be many more sons of our church who will feel the call of the Holy Spirit to go out into this world of sin and to preach a message of hope to a dying humanity.

##### 30:12

God has blessed me in the forty years in the ministry.

I have finished forty years and have never missed a Sunday in forty years because of illness.

I thank God for that.

I don't deserve that kind of mercy from Him.

So many of you have said to me, well when are you going to retire?

Well, now that you offer me a home, I can assure you that it's a big inducement.

But as long as God gives me health and strength and you are satisfied, I hope I can continue.

When you aren't satisfied, if you'll just whisper into my ear that you'd like a change, I shall take the hint and I shall gladly relinquish the duties here at Emanuel to younger shoulders and perhaps more energetic shoulders.

##### 31:10

It's been a great day and all of us appreciate it so very much.

Paul, it's been kind of you to say what you have said.

Thank you so much.
