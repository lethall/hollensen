## Synopsis
This is an entire worship service, including Rev. Hollensen's announcement of retirement. Jesus warns us that we should always remind ourselves that God does not owe us anything. This is the antidote for temptation to works righteousness and the desire to be judged on merits. Satan works in two primary ways: to get us to follow the world or to cause us to think we are good enough to save ourselves.

## Transcript
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

...

##### 19:56

Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Let us hear the Word of God as we find it written in Saint Luke's gospel, reading there in the 17th chapter, beginning at the seventh verse.

**But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.**

Now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

Oh Lord our strength and our redeemer.

Amen.

##### 21:03

Good morning, dear friends in Christ Jesus.

It is good to be here in God's house to worship, I am sure, and I hope we are all glad to be here.

Today is the sixteenth Sunday after Trinity.

The Word of God that I just read tells a parable that Jesus spoke.

It's called the parable of the unprofitable servant.

He spoke it at the time when he was over in the region east of the Jordan in Perea.

There were before him his apostles and his followers.

It's a rather unusual parable because it's in the form of a question.

And Jesus said to his followers that day in this parable, he said, Which of you, if you had a servant, out in the field who was plowing the field and who was feeding the cattle, who when he had finished a job came in in the evening, which one of you would say, Oh, come in, I've got a meal all prepared for you?

Jesus said, You wouldn't do that now, would you?

Because the servant out in the field was doing his duty.

##### 22:04

He was doing his job.

He was doing that which you had commanded him to do.

And therefore you wouldn't have a special meal for him, now would you?

And the answer of course would be no.

Jesus said, Wouldn't you rather do this if you had the servant?

So when he came in you would say, Now you may get ready and change your clothes and prepare a meal for me.

And after you have served me and I have eaten, then you may sit down.

And that you may eat.

And then Jesus says, Now if you had a servant like that who was doing his duty, would you give him big special thanks because he had done his job, the thing that you had commanded?

And Jesus said, I'm sure you wouldn't give him special thanks.

And then Jesus says, So likewise ye, when ye have done all things that have been commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.

We have done that which was our duty to do.

What was Jesus talking about?

Even as Jesus was saying to them, If you had a servant like that, would you feel that you owed him something special?

##### 23:03

And so Jesus says, In the same way I want you to know this my apostles and my followers, that when you have done everything as one of my followers, when you have done everything that has been commanded you and you have done your duty, be sure to say to yourselves, We are unprofitable servants.

We are undeserving servants.

To say, God, you don't owe me salvation and eternal life at all.

And so today Jesus speaks to you and me in this parable as Christians.

And he says to you and he says to me this morning, When we have done everything that has been commanded of us in our Christian life, when we have done the good deeds whereby we have lived a moral life, when we have done those deeds of mercy and kindness to our fellow man, when you and I have done those deeds where we have endured many things for him, Jesus says, When you have done everything that is expected of you as a Christian, I plead with you, remember this and never forget it, be sure to say to yourselves, We are unprofitable servants.

To say, God, I am undeserving of eternal life.

##### 24:16

You don't owe me salvation.

God, I have no claim on you whatsoever.

You are not obligated in any way, shape, or form to save me because of my deeds, because of what I have done.

You and I may say, That's hard to believe that Jesus calls to you and me.

Write it on your hearts.

Never forget it.

Keep it uppermost at the end of every day when you look at your Christian life and you look at all of the good deeds that you have done, deeds of goodness and kindness and mercy and endurance, Jesus says, I plead with you, never forget for a moment.

Hold it steadfast.

Be sure always to say, I am an unprofitable servant.

##### 25:01

I am undeserving, God.

You don't owe me salvation and eternal life at all.

We may say this is hard to believe that Jesus would say, This is so urgent and I plead you never forget it, because we may say, What's so important about saying in your Christian life and mine?

When we have done the good deeds that we're supposed to do and our duty, when we have lived that moral life that God asked us to live as a Christian, when we have gone out of our way to show mercy and kindness, and when we have endured again the criticism and the cynicism of individuals, Jesus said, But be sure, never forget to say, God, you don't owe me a thing.

God, you don't owe me eternal life in view of all of my deeds.

You don't owe me salvation at all.

And we'd say, What is so important and so vital and so urgent?

And Jesus would remind you and me this morning, whether we realize or not, that this is an absolute must, that as Christians in our Christian life from day to day, we've got to keep it in mind and never under any circumstances forget it, that we are unprofitable servants, that you and I can say to God, God, you don't owe me salvation at all.

This is an absolute essential.

##### 26:14

We may say, Why is this so essential?

Why is this a matter of life and death, that in your Christian life and mine every day, that we never for a moment forget to say to ourselves, when we look at all the things that we have done as Christians, But God, you don't owe me eternal life.

You don't owe me a thing.

I have no claim on you whatsoever.

Jesus would remind you and me this morning that this is a matter of life and death.

This is a matter of tremendous importance because Christ says, When we do this, when we say, I'm never going to forget this, whatever I accomplish in my Christian life, whenever we say, I'm going to keep on reminding myself and never forget it, then Jesus says, This will be a big preventive.

This is an antidote that you and I will not slip into the sin and the error of work righteousness.

##### 27:05

What happens in your Christian life and mine when we forget this for a moment?

What happens when you and I may look at our life and say, Look at all the things that I've done for you.

Look at the life that I've lived as a Christian.

Look at the mercy and the kindness that I've done.

Look at all the things that I have endured, Lord Jesus, for you.

When we forget then to say, But you don't owe me salvation, then we say, But you do owe me salvation.

And that means that we have slid into the sin of work righteousness.

It means we're telling God, God, I am saving myself.

I'm working my own way to heaven.

But what does the Scripture say about this?

How many of us feel that by our deeds and by our goodnesses that God owes us something?

The least that God owes us is eternal life and everlasting salvation.

But what does the Word of God say?

Doesn't the Word of God say there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not?

Doesn't the Word of God say that all of our righteousnesses are as filthy rags?

Doesn't the Word of God say who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, not one?

If in your life and mine, when we live the Christian life and we fail to write it on our souls and to remember this, that God, you owe me nothing.

You don't owe me eternal life.

Then we slip over and we say, God, yes, you do owe me something.

You are indebted to me, God.

You are under obligation to save me.

##### 28:26

And that means that we're saving ourselves.

And you may say, Is that so terrible that we say to God, Look at all I've done for you.

You ought to save me.

The horrible thing about it is this, that what we're doing, whether we realize it or not, we are saying, God, I don't need Jesus Christ as my Savior.

He could have stayed in heaven.

I'm going to be my own Savior.

And when you and I spit upon Jesus Christ, when we may do it, oh, with all kinds of competence, and we may do it in seeming courtesy, whenever we turn to Christ and say, I don't need you.

Then what are we saying?

God, we didn't need the Word of God.

We didn't need the 4,000 years preparation that you took in sending Christ into the world.

We didn't need to have you shape the destiny of nations, that after 4,000 years you established the nation of Israel.

And from Israel there came the Savior.

##### 29:14

Then we're saying to God, I don't need a Savior.

This is why Jesus says, Please, I urge you, in your Christian life every day, whatever you do, whatever you accomplish, and all those good deeds and those kind things and the merciful things and whatever you endure, don't ever forget for a moment to be able to say, I am an unprofitable servant.

I am not worthy.

God, you don't owe me eternal life because it means this tragedy that we have repudiated Jesus Christ, made ourselves our own Savior.

We have said to Jesus, You could have stayed in heaven.

You didn't have to come into the world to save me.

Is it any wonder that Jesus, in speaking to his followers, he told them there, in this parable, it's a tremendous thing, when you've done everything, when as the Christian, Jesus says, you have done all those deeds, good deeds, moral deeds, deeds of mercy and kindness, that you have endured everything Jesus says, don't for a moment ever forget this, to always say, but I am an unprofitable servant.

God, I'm not deserving of anything.

You don't owe me eternal life.

##### 30:24

We may say, Why?

What's so all fired important about that?

Why is that a matter of life and death?

Because Jesus reminds you and me also that when we do this, when we look at our Christian life, whatever has been accomplished in our lives, and we say, But God, you don't owe me a thing.

You don't owe me eternal life.

Then this is a preventive in your life and mine.

It'll keep us from forgetting the fact that it's Jesus' righteousness that has delivered you and me from hell, and it's not your righteousness and mine.

When we remember to say every day in our Christian life, regardless of our accomplishments in the kingdom of God, and again the good deeds in your life and mine, when we say, But God, you don't owe me a thing.

You don't owe me eternal life.

##### 31:05

The very fact that we admit it and we say, This is a conviction of mine, we are saying what?

We are saying, Now I know that it's the righteousness of Christ that has delivered me from hell, not my own righteousness.

Isn't that what the scriptures say?

Jesus, who was God's Son, who was holy and without sin came into this world.

Being the eternal Son of God, He was bigger than you and I and the entire human race.

He was of more value.

He came into the world and born of the Virgin Mary without sin.

And He on the cross, He died for our sins.

And when He who was big enough, when He bore hell and damnation in your stead and mine, He merited a perfect righteousness.

And that's the righteousness that God accepted and proved by His resurrection.

That righteousness and the righteousness of Jesus alone, that's what delivers you and me from hell.

But if in your Christian life and mine we forget this, and we stop saying to ourselves, I am an unprofitable servant.

##### 32:02

God, you don't owe me a thing.

You don't owe me eternal life for anything that I've done in your kingdom.

When we can say that, then we're going to be spared this tragedy of turning our backs on Jesus and of losing the deliverance from eternal death in eternal darkness.

Sometimes we must say, what's the difference whether I'm lost or not?

What's the difference whether I spend eternity in hell?

But I can't help but remember what Jesus said about Judas.

When Judas went and took his own life unrepentant to the end, and Jesus said about him, it would have been better for that man if he had never been born.

Hell must be hell if again to be delivered from it and then to lose it and to spend an eternity in hell, that Jesus said it would have been better if you had never seen the light of day.

Therefore no wonder Christ says, I plead with you my followers.

And He was talking to His own that day.

He said, will you, and I urge you, never forget for a moment when you look at your Christian life, when you've done everything that I've commanded you and you've done your duty, always say to yourself, but I am an unprofitable servant.

##### 33:06

God you don't owe me a thing.

God you are not obligated to me.

I have no claim on you for eternal life whatsoever.

When we do the, here is, here is a preventive, here is an antidote that will keep you on me that we will not forget the fact that it's Christ's righteousness.

And also Jesus would remind us that then and only then will we never forget that it's the righteousness of Christ that has brought eternal life and heaven as a gift for us.

It is not your righteousness and mine.

If in your Christian life and mine we begin to say, God look what I've done in my life.

Look what I've accomplished for you.

Look at the good deeds that I have done, the fine things.

Look at the moral life that I have lived.

Look at the merciful things that I have done to my fellow man.

Look at the cross again that I have given.

Look at the things that I have endured.

And if we forget for the moment to then say, but listen you don't owe me a thing God.

You are not under any obligation to save me for all that I've done doing what you've commanded and my duty.

##### 34:07

Jesus says, when we can say that, then here is an antidote to this that we're going to then say, because after all it's not my righteousness that brings heaven.

It's the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

It was God's Son wasn't it?

He who came into the world who by his death on the cross he merited a perfect 100% righteousness for all of us.

That in that righteousness there is heaven and eternal life, not in your righteousness and mine because we have none.

All of our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.

When in our Christian experience we can say to ourselves, God you don't owe me a thing because of that.

Oh we're going to be spared this horrible tragedy of turning our backs on Jesus Christ and losing him.

It must be a horrible thing to lose heaven.

Sometimes we may say, does it make much difference whether I shall spend eternity with God in heaven or not?

When Jesus said one day about it to try to get us to think, he said, what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

##### 35:08

What would you have if you actually gained the whole world?

You had all the pleasures the world could offer.

And you and I know that in the pleasures of life, whatever they are, the fine things they never satisfy.

There's always that yearning isn't there?

There's always something God made us so that nothing satisfies, even the good things in life.

The only satisfaction that we have is Jesus Christ.

Isn't that right?

And therefore what a tragedy it would be if you and I as Christians, we would forget to say when we look at our lives and say, God look at the deeds.

And oh there ought to be a lot of them.

Look at what I've done.

Look at the fine things.

Look at the merciful things.

Look what I have endured.

But Jesus said, oh please, when you look at your life, when you have done what I've commanded you, and when you've done your duty, always be sure to say and never forget it.

But God, you don't owe me salvation.

You don't owe me a thing God.

I am an unworthy, I am an unprosperous servant, and therefore God, you don't owe me one thing.

##### 36:06

You are not under obligation.

I am unworthy of it.

And Jesus says, and never forget it.

Always say it.

Never let it be gone because it saves that tragedy.

And we may say, is it that important that in your life and mine, when we look at our Christian lives and we say, I've done a lot of nice things for you Lord.

I've done a lot of good things.

I've done a lot of merciful things and kind things.

And I've endured a lot, Jesus.

Oh fine, but Christ says, remember always say this, never forget it please, but I'm an unprofitable servant.

God, you don't owe me salvation.

Why?

Because Jesus says, here is an antidote.

Here is a preventive that will cause you and me never to forget that salvation is by the grace of God and not by one good work on your part and mine.

We use this word grace a lot and it has a number of different meanings.

We know it means love.

We know it means undeserved love.

But when we talk about salvation and we say salvation is by grace, what do we mean?

We mean this.

##### 37:08

That the entire salvation has been bought and paid for through Jesus Christ alone without Christ wanting one good deed or one good work from me or from any man.

It was all done by him.

God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.

Grace means this, that salvation comes to us not as a reward of something we have done, not the result of any deeds of mercy and kindness, but by God's grace God paid for it in the blood of his Son, paid for in full before you and I were ever born.

And when we say to ourselves in all the deeds of our life, God you don't owe me a thing.

You don't owe me salvation.

Then we're going to remember this is an antidote, lest we forget that salvation is by grace.

It's through faith, not by our deeds.

##### 38:04

And when we can say to ourselves, God I've done a lot of things for you in the kingdom.

I've done a lot of good works, a lot of deeds of mercy and kindness, but you don't owe me a thing.

You don't owe me eternal life.

Then we're going to be saved the tragedy of really saying to God, God I want you to save me not because of your grace, but I want to be saved on the basis of your justice.

How many of us want to be saved on the basis of justice?

God you owe it to me.

You owe it to me.

Look what I've done.

Look what I've done in the kingdom.

You owe me salvation and eternal life.

And God said, you want me to give it to you on the basis of justice and not on the basis of grace, not on the basis of my mercy, not in exchange for sorrow for sin, and just by putting your trust in Jesus, you want me to do it on the basis of justice.

And then God said, you know what justice means?

And God says to you and me this morning, I am the Almighty God.

Walk before me and be thou perfect.

God says, you want me to save you on the basis of justice?

That I owe it to you?

Have you ever thought an evil thought?

You and I have to say yes.

##### 39:04

And God say, if you thought an evil thought, again you're not perfect.

You're a sinner.

My justice damns you.

I have to.

It's all I can do.

Have you ever spoken an evil word?

I've got to say yes.

Have you ever done an evil deed?

And you and I would have to say yes.

Have you ever left undone a deed of mercy and kindness that you could have done?

And we'd have to say yes.

And God say, you want me to save you on the basis of my perfect justice?

On the basis of justice, I must damn you forever to hell.

The only way I can save you is on the basis of grace.

You see, it's so important, isn't it, in your Christian life and mine, because you see, salvation is by grace.

And the only way we're going to remember that is when we're going to say to ourselves at the close of every day, whatever we have done, in the good things that we have done in our Christian experience, in the merciful things, in the kind things, in the things we've endured, in the hardships, and again, the sacrifices we have made, that we keep on saying, but listen God, you don't owe me a thing.

##### 40:01

I am an unworthy, undeserving servant.

You don't owe me salvation and eternal life.

You're not obligated.

I have no claim on you whatsoever.

Jesus says, never forget it.

Why?

Because only then, when we can keep this thing in mind, do we realize, and will this be an antidote that will not forget the fact that all of the deeds in your life and mine, they are meant to be our expressions of thanks to God for having saved us in Christ.

They are not meritorious in any way, shape, or form.

When in your Christian experience and mine, we begin to feel that God has sort of obligated to us and God owes us something, we are saying to God, God my works are meritorious.

These are meritorious works that earn something, that I've got some merit, and therefore you owe me heaven.

What is the purpose of the works in your life and mine, and the deeds of mercy and kindness?

The Word of God assures us this is our way of saying thank you.

This is our way of saying Christ, I am so grateful that you have saved me, that the only way in which I can show it is in my life, in the deeds, in doing my duty, and doing the things which you have commanded me.

##### 41:05

And oh, that saves a horrible tragedy if we forget it in our Christian experience, and got the idea that God owes us something, it means we're going to stand before Christ at the last day, and Jesus is going to say, I'll spew you out of my mouth.

I don't even know you.

Why?

Because you and I don't know Him.

How many of us don't know Him?

We just don't know Him.

Somehow or other we've got the idea that we look at our lives and what we've done, and oh, we feel God is so obligated that God owes it to us in the world.

People say to me, how do you know that Christianity is true?

Do you realize there's only one religion on the face of the earth that's a religion of grace, where God has done it all, in the person of His Son and God says here it's a gift?

All other religions say you've got to work for it.

You've got to strive, you've got to do it by your deeds, you've got to sacrifice, you've got to go out, and you've got to keep on and on.

How do I know it's true?

##### 42:01

It's true because it's the great revelation of grace.

It must have come out of heaven.

You and I could never have conceived a God so gracious and merciful and kind that God, apart from you and me, not one work on our part, prepares salvation in the person of His Son and says, here it is.

And isn't it a joy when we say, I'm going to remember this in my Christian life.

I'm going to see to it that there's never a day.

I don't care what I do for Him that I'm ever going to say to myself, God you owe me something.

You owe me eternal life.

And oh, then there's this joy that in this religion of grace, if you and I have been stuffed shirts and we have felt that God's obligated to us, isn't it a wonderful thing that there is forgiveness with Him?

You know, Satan has two ways of getting you and me to be lost.

One is to get us to throw ourselves to the world, to go out and live to the world in immorality and incest.

And the other one is to make you and me feel that God's obligated to us, that we've been so good and so wonderful, and that again God owes it to us.

##### 43:03

And when in your life and mine we begin to feel that God owes us something, that God's obligated to us, that means that we have spurned Jesus Christ and Calvary.

How many of us don't know Him?

We've spurned Him.

You know, Paul was that way.

Some people had the idea that they thought that Paul was an immoral man before his conversion.

He wasn't. He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees.

There was a man that had the idea, God, you owe me salvation, look me over.

Until he met his Christ on the Damascus Way.

Then he was able to cry out, oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

Oh, what work righteousness can do.

But there is forgiveness even for that.

To stand and to say, God, I haven't thrown my life in immorality, but oh, I have spurned your son.

I have felt in my life that you owe me something.

Then to be able to turn to Jesus Christ and to His grace and say, forgive me.

Forgive me that I have spurned you.

You are the only way.

And then there comes this joy, the joy again, that in your Christian experience and mine we can have the hope of salvation based upon God's grace.

##### 44:14

On what do you and I base our hope of eternal life?

Is it on the basis of what we've done?

On the basis of our deeds, when again our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, if so, that's a horrible basis, isn't it, when death comes.

But oh, if we can base it on the grace of God, on something that God has done in Christ, and that we have accepted Him as our Lord and Savior, this is certainty, isn't it, in the changes that come in life.

And God knows there's going to be changes in your life and mine in the next couple of months.

Who knows what they're all going to be?

I don't know.

But I do know this, that you and I don't like change, do we?

It bothers us to uproot, doesn't it?

It bothers me.

It's a heavy heart.

And yet I do know this, that when you and I have Christ, we have the grace of God, that there is always this peace and this certainty, that we are saved, and that we know Him, and that we have eternal life.

And this drives fears, doesn't it?

And this gives us hope.

##### 45:10

And all the changes are when the shadows begin to lengthen.

And we look out, and the future seems so uncertain, that we can still say, but oh God is a God of grace.

And therefore, in Jesus, I put my faith, and my hope, and my trust, that we can walk the glory road then and sing the song of grace.

This is the song that we must sing.

When we have said to ourselves, I'm never going to forget for a moment that God doesn't owe me salvation, in spite of all the things that I have done for Him.

We can sing, someday the silver cord will break, and I as now no more shall sing, but oh the joy when I shall wake within the palace of the King, and I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story saved by grace.

And I shall see Him face to face, and tell the story saved by grace.

Amen.

##### 46:08

The peace of God which passeth all human understanding, keep and unite your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus unto life everlasting.

...

The Lord lift up His countenance upon Thee and give Thee peace. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

##### 61:35
