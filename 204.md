## Synopsis
Rev Hollensen explains each part of the Lutheran order of worship. Rev. Basler delivers the sermon dealing with greatness in the Kingdom of God.

## Transcript
 Since ours is a Trinitarian church, which means that while we believe that our God is one God, but nevertheless three Persons, we open our service this morning in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Amen.

Your singing of the Amen means that that is also what you believe.

We stand here in God's house.

God is holy, and you and I are sinners.

Therefore, we think of our sins, and I would invite you, therefore, that we turn to Christ and ask Him for forgiveness, remembering this as the psalmist declares, that our help is in the name of the Lord.

Since we have sinned against God, therefore we recall also the words of the psalmist.

I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord.

Lord God, we turn to You to confess our sins.

We find it rather easy to admit that we were born and conceived in sin, but quite difficult to stand before You and to admit that we have sinned against You in thought and in word and in deed.

But we do so confess, asking for Thy forgiving grace in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and our Savior, confessing our sins in this prayer.

O most merciful God, who hast given thine own begotten Son to die for us, have mercy upon us, and for His sake grant us remission of all our sins, and by Thy Holy Spirit increase in us true knowledge of Thee, and of Thy will, and through obedience to
Thy Word, that by Thy grace we may come to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

I stand before You as a congregation, as a sinner, even as You are also a sinner.

Yet I stand in the stead of God, and because You have confessed Your sins and asked for forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ, I declare unto You the forgiveness of Your sins.

You at this moment stand before God as though You had never sinned.

Let us remember and believe He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.

Grant this, O Lord, unto us all.

And now we turn to the intro at End Our Service, which is a brief section of Scripture which keeps us in mind as regards this season of the Church year.

Be Thou my strong rock, for in house of defense to save me, Thou art my rock in my fortress.

Therefore, for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me.

In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.

Let me never be ashamed.

Deliver me in Thy righteousness.

For we are the ones and only ones, and for the King is our God and the King of kings, world wide and wide.

You have just done Your glory and Your praise to our Triune God, God who is glorious and who was in eternity, who is glorious now and who will also be glorious throughout all eternity.

Having had our sins forgiven, we now turn to Christ and we ask for mercy with regard to the other needs in our Christian life.

In Thee and in peace, let us therefore pray to the Lord.

We pray, O Lord, for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls.

We pray, O Lord, for the peace of the whole world, for the well-being of the churches of God and for the unity of all.

We pray, O Lord Christ, for this holy house, and for them that in faith, piety, and fear of God, offer here their worship and praise.

Help save pity and defend us, O God, by Thy grace.

Having had our sins forgiven and having received the mercy of Christ, giving us strength in the needs of our life, we now sing our song of praise to God, Glory be to God on High.

O Lord, we pray, O Lord, for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls.

Happy is the way to the kingdom of the world, and to the world above.

We sing our praise.

Happy is the way to the kingdom of the world, and to the world above.

O, we are holy, O, we are holy, O, we look right with holy homes, Christ the Christ, glory of God the Father, Amen.

It was not my privilege to have greeted each one of you as you came into God's house, and so in this place and the service I do so.

The Lord be with you.

You have therefore also greeted me and wished God's blessing to me, even as I have to you.

We shall now pray the collect a brief prayer for this season of the church year.

O Lord, we beseech Thee, mercifully hear our prayers, and having set us free from the bonds of sin, defend us from all evil.

To Thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end.

In the Christian church this Sunday is known as Quinqua Jesum, a Sunday.

That word means the numeral 50, which means that we are now about 50 days away from Easter.

In the ancient Christian church there were selected epistle lessons read at the Sunday service.

This is the ancient epistle for this day, which today is being read in hundreds of thousands of Christian churches.

Millions will hear this very section of scripture, which gives you and me the thrill of seeing the unity of the kingdom of God, the real unity of the Christian church here upon earth.

The ancient epistle lesson taken from Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, the 13th chapter, that which we know as the love chapter of the New Testament.

I may speak in tongues of men or of angels, but if I am without love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

I may have the gift of prophecy and know every hidden truth.

I may have faith strong enough to move mountains, but if I have no love, I am nothing.

I may dole out all I possess or even give my body to be burnt, but if I have no love, I am none the better.

Love is patient.

Love is kind and envies no one.

Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude, never selfish, not quick to take offense.

Love keeps no score of wrongs, does not gloat over other men's sins, but delights in the truth.

There is nothing love cannot face.

There is no limit to its faith, its hope, and its endurance.

Love will never come to an end.

Are there prophets?

Their work will be over.

Are there tongues of ecstasy?

They will cease.

Is there knowledge?

It will vanish away.

For our knowledge and our prophecy alike are partial, and the partial vanishes when wholeness comes.

When I was a child, my speech, my outlook, and my thoughts were all childish.

When I grew up, I had finished with childish things.

Now we see only puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we shall see face to face.

My knowledge now is partial.

Then it will be whole, like God's knowledge of me.

In a word, there are three things that last forever, faith, hope, love.

But the greatest of them all is love.

Hereineth the ancient epistle for this Sunday.

Then the gradually brief section of scripture that again is in keeping with this season of the church year.

Thou art the God that doest wonders.

Thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

Serve the Lord with gladness.

Alleluia.

And so we have just sung our alleluias, three of them.

An alleluia which means praise the Lord, one to God the Father, one to God the Son, and one to God the Holy Ghost.

The ancient gospel lesson that will be heard in hundreds of thousands of Christian churches throughout the world this Sunday is written in the 18th chapter of St.

Luke beginning at the 31st verse.

We sing our glory especially to Christ because the gospel lesson brings us this Christ and all of his beauty.

He took the twelve aside and said, we are now going up to Jerusalem and all that was written by the prophets will come true for the Son of Man.

He will be handed over to the foreign power.

He will be mocked, maltreated, and spat upon.

They will flog him and kill him.

And on the third day he will rise again.

But they understood nothing of all this.

They did not grasp what he was talking about.

Its meaning was concealed from them.

As he approached Jericho, a blind man sat at the roadside begging.

Hearing a crowd going past, he asked what was happening.

They told him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.

Then he shouted out, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.

The people in front told him sharply to hold his tongue.

But he called out all the more, Son of David, have pity on me.

Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him.

When he came up he asked him, what do you want me to do for you?

Sir, I want my sight back, he answered.

Jesus said to him, have back your sight.

Your faith has cured you.

He recovered his sight instantly and he followed Jesus praising God.

And all the people gave praise to God for what they had seen.

Here in the ancient gospel of the Christian church.

In the very first century of the Christian church, Christians were an oddity and people were asking them, what do you Christians believe?

Heathens, those who did not know Christ, wondered what is this new faith?

And so there grew up even in the first century a statement of what Christians believe.

It was not written by the apostles, but they helped form it even as other Christians.

It has come down in the Christian church for nearly 2,000 years.

It is still the finest expression that you and I have today of telling someone else what we as Christians believe.

Let us confess and speak what we believe in the words of the Apostles Creed.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under conscious pilot, was crucified dead and buried.

He descended into hell.

The third day he rose again from the dead.

He ascended into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Christian church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

Amen.

On behalf of Emmanuel Congregation, I bid a warm and Christian welcome to you our visitors and guests.

We are very happy to have you worshipping with us.

We shall appreciate it as a kindness if you will take the time to sign one of the guest registries before you leave church today.

There is always a nursery in operation during the times of our worship services as well as during the Sunday school hour.

Our regular schedule begins each Sunday morning with an early service at 8 o'clock, followed by Sunday school at 9.

15,this service at 10.

30,and this service on the air over the Marion Station WMRN each Sunday at 10.

45.

God willing I shall give the Bible study Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock in the library located on the first floor of our educational building.

While the Bible study is primarily for the Bible study leaders of the Emmanuel Lutheran Church women, nevertheless all men and women who would like to share that Bible hour, they are cordially invited to attend Tuesday at 7 o'clock.

As we know this coming Wednesday is known in the Christian church as Ash Wednesday.

It's the day that begins the Lenten season.

We shall begin therefore our Lenten vesper services this coming Wednesday night at 7.

30.

We shall celebrate Holy Community with Pastor Basler assisting.

The general theme that I shall use this year will be this, my Christ and I at the cross.

Wednesday night at 7.

30,perhaps in your busy life and in mine, we can find an extra hour in the Lenten season to come to God's house and to have our Lord speak to us about his sufferings and death and our behalf.

Ash Wednesday night, 7.

30.

One week from tomorrow night, which will be the first Monday night in March, March the 4th, God willing I shall begin a series of lectures for adults on the Christian religion.

Monday night, March the 4th at 7.

30.

We shall have a nursery to take care of your children.

At the close of the lecture period at 9, we shall have a refreshment hour.

You may say who is invited to attend the series of adult lectures.

May I say this, anyone within the sound of my voice or anybody who is not as far as that's concerned, who would like to sit down and take a look at the Christian religion.

What is the Christian faith?

I assure you, you will not obligate yourself to this church.

I will not ask you any questions.

I will not embarrass you in any way, shape, or form.

But if you wonder what the Christian religion is all about, I would like the opportunity to tell you.

And I hope that you, the members of the congregation, in the world in which you move, that you have found some who do not know Christ, who do not know what the Christian faith is, and that you have already invited them to come with you the first Monday
night in March at 7.

30.

I've asked Pastor Basler to preach the sermon at this service even as he did at the early service this morning.

Now after an anthem by our senior choir in the Christian church choirs sang to the glory of God, we should unite in singing hymn number 562, The Son of God Goes Forth to War.

The sermon was the high spot in the worship of the Christian church, even as it is in our church today when God's word is brought to us through the instrumentality of one of his servants.

never liked to appear before the Lord empty-handed.

And so in our Church we worship our God also with our gifts, the material things that we have, thus showing that we recognize God as the giver of every good and perfect gift which we possess.

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Amen.

Amen.

Our total attendance this morning, 1,027.

There were 421 at the first service, 606 at the service, 1,027 for the morning.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Amen.

Let us arise.

Amen.

We bring our all thanks to our Lord.

We present it to Him in the name of Jesus Christ, knowing that in Jesus our offering is acceptable.

And then we join in an offertory, which is a prayer that we sing.

Having heard the word of God, asking God to create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit, even as David prayed in the 51st Psalm.

Heavenly Father, we give Thee but Thine own whate'er the gift may be.

All that we have is Thine alone.

A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

Amen.

I am Lord of the fields within Thee.

And Thee are the way of my family.

And Thee are my own King.

In the kingdom of Thee belong to Thee.

The joy of Thy holy youth, let us hold Thee with our peace.

O Lord God, whose ways are mercy and truth, to such as keep Thy covenant and Thy testimonies, let Thy peace, like the gentle dew from heaven, fall upon all who have come this day into Thy house, to offer unto Thee the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving.

For Thy name's sake, pardon our iniquity.

Remember not the sins of our youth nor our transgressions, but in Thy great mercy look upon our desolation, the sharpness of our afflictions, and the reproach our sins have earned, and forgive us.

Restore our souls, lead us in Thy truth, teach us Thy way, show us Thy paths, make Thy face to shine upon us, and be gracious unto us, and bring us out of all of our distresses.

O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in whom we live and move and have our being, bless this day to our growth in grace.

Bless this house that it may be continually, a place where Thine honor dwells.

Thy name is praised and Thy truth is proclaimed.

Bless our homes, that they may be rooted and grounded in love and every good word.

Help all those among us who may be enduring any affliction, trial, or adversity, and reveal the exceeding greatness of Thy power to all who believe.

O God, we come to Thy throne of grace, praying that nuclear war shall not come into this world, which Thou didst create and of which Thou didst say, that, behold, it is very good.

Control this power among nations, Lord God, and, O, somehow, someway in Thy will, Lord God, do Thou bring an end to the war that plagues mankind this day.

Watch over our children, our sons, and our daughters in the dangerous and the strategic places in this world.

Keep them in Christ Jesus.

Grant them that peace which the world cannot give and the assurance of eternal life in Him.

And grant us, Lord God, that as we go forth from Thy sanctuary, that we may strive for greatness as Thou wouldst have us to be great, that we may dedicate our lives in love to the service of one another.

O to love all men, Lord Jesus, and that in Thou our lives men may see Thee and learn to glorify Thee as their Christ and their Lord.

Then, Lord Jesus, our lives have not been lived in vain.

We ask it in Thy name.

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for mine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.

Amen.

We have just with the Christian Church on earth joined in our prayer to our God, knowing that God always hears and that God always answers.

And then we prayed that prayer which our Lord, when He was here on earth, has taught us to pray, the Lord's Prayer.

Now we shall turn and sing our praise to our God, hymn 537, O Master, let me walk with Thee.

Let me walk with Thee.

In all the life of heaven and earth we see.

Let me walk with Thee.

Let all be then the praise of God, the praise of Thee.

Let all be then the hope of God to you.

Let all be then the joy of God.

Let me walk with Thee tonight, and join with Him the whole day.

Give me my faith and fill with fear.

Give all to Him the power of my being.

Give work to Him, give work to Him, and love Him more than I am more.

Give all that there was not in vain.

I am not free, therefore, in vain.

Give me my hope, give my hope, and give, give me your love, and let me be.

Aum Receive the Benediction of the Lord.

Moses and Aaron lived 1,500 years before Christ.

That means about 3,500 years ago.

In that day God said to Aaron, Aaron, when you bless the people, you say these words.

We know it as the Benediction.

It's the oldest part of the Christian worship service, 3,500 years old.

And we still use the Aaronic Benediction when God says, Aaron, this is the way you bless the people.

The Lord bless thee and keep thee.

The Lord make His face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee.

The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee and give thee peace.

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

Amen.

Amen.

I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there
with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all
night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long,
I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there with you all night long, I will be there
with you all night long,
