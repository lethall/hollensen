## Transcript
 Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in the Gospel according to Saint Luke, reading there in the 13th chapter, beginning at the 10th verse.

And he was preaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

And behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself.

And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorified God.

And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because the Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work.

In them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.

The Lord then answered him and said, Thou hypocrite, dost not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?

And not, not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound lo these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?

And when he hath said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed, and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord our strength and our Redeemer.

Amen.

Good morning dear friends in Christ Jesus.

You may say to me, well it's not a very good morning, oh it's rather dark and dismal, but I do hope that with Christ in our hearts there is joy there, and that we appreciate the privilege of coming to church and to worshiping our God this day.

Today's in all the 17th Sunday after Trinity.

The incident that I just read from the Word of God took place over in the region of Perea, that region east of the Jordan, sometime in the four month period before Jesus did.

We are told that it was the Sabbath day, in front of the synagogue, just where in Pria we are not told, but he was in that synagogue on this Sabbath and he was teaching.

We are told that there was in his audience on that Saturday morning, there was a woman who again had suffered for 18 years because of an evil spirit.

And it manifested itself in this way, that this woman was bent over and she simply could not stand erect.

Picture her then in church way over and she simply could not stand up in that kind of a position for 18 years.

And Jesus when he saw her, he called her to him and he said, woman thou art loose from thine infirmity.

And he laid his hand on her and we are told that immediately that woman who could not straighten up for 18 years, she stood up and naturally she glorified God.

But the ruler, the president of the congregation was very indignant and he was very embittered and he had a lot of cruel words to say about working on the Sabbath.

But this morning we'd like to look at this miracle of healing that Jesus performed on a certain Sabbath somewhere in Pria.

It is written in the Word of God and Jesus would have you and me do this because of this miracle of healing, to thank him, to praise him, to express our gratitude to him for this miracle of healing.

Healing a woman who again was bent over for 18 long years.

And you and I may say to ourselves, I am to thank Christ, I am to praise him, I am to express appreciation to him because nearly 2,000 years ago somewhere in Pria he healed a woman that was bent over double for 18 years.

We may say to ourselves this morning, why?

What does it mean to me?

Does it give me any assurance with regard to him?

Does this miracle of healing give me any comfort, not only when I am ill, when I am sick, but also comfort every day of my life?

And Jesus would call upon you and me this morning to thank him and to praise him for this miracle of healing because it would remind us that there is great assurance, there is a great guarantee, there is great certainty that you and I have about him
because of this miracle of healing.

And there is certainly great comfort and consolation and solace not only when you and I are real, but each moment of our lives.

Let's look at this miracle this morning.

What about assurance?

Christ would remind you and me in the first place that this miracle of healing that he performed, yes, nearly 2,000 years ago over in Pria, that this miracle assures you and me that he was no less than God, that he was no less than the Savior.

What is there as regards assurance in this miracle?

The fact that he was able by a word to bring healing to a woman was seemingly a hopeless case.

You and I say he must have been God to have done that.

You know Isaiah, the prophet who lived 700 years before Jesus came, said that when Messiah would come, he said, Behold, the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emanuel, which means God with us.

He's going to be God and he's going to be the Almighty God.

He is going to do the miraculous.

And so again, it had been predicted of Messiah that when he comes, he would do the miraculous.

It was necessary when Jesus was here on earth in order to show that he was the Messiah, that he was the one about whom Isaiah said, that he was the one who would restore sight to the blind, who would do the miraculous, that he would do miracles and that
these would be signs to attest to the fact that he was more than a man.

He was no less than God himself.

This was the purpose of the miraculous even as we see it in this miracle of healing.

It goes without saying that I can understand why in the church the matter of the miracle should be something that is causing so much trouble.

That there are those in the church who are saying these miracles just really didn't happen.

This is the way men wrote in that day.

These are similes.

These are nothing but illustrations.

These are nice myths in order to show the greatness of Christ.

But I always like to ask this question.

If they were factual, if these things were as men say they were not, if these were actually original historic events, how would you say it any more than what it said here?

Jesus said, You're loath, and again the woman stood up.

How would you say it if it wasn't a miracle, if it wasn't a fact?

What about the miracle?

The miracle, why?

Jesus had to give proof that he was no less than God himself, that he could do something that man could not do.

This is assurance.

How do I know that Jesus of Nazareth was no less than God as the scriptures tell us, that he was second person of the Trinity, and that he was the Messiah by the miracle, by a simple miracle of healing over here in Perea he attested to his deity.

And that brings comfort, and I hope it does in your Christian life and mine, not only in the day of illness, but all the days of our life that he was big enough to be our Lord and to be our Savior.

I believe the miracles happened.

I believe they were historic.

I believe they were factual.

I can't interpret it any other way.

These occurred.

These were not fairy tales.

These were not sagas.

These were not nice little illustrations.

Christ healed the woman.

That's what the Word of God says.

And oh, what comfort then.

No wonder Jesus would call upon you and me to thank and praise him that again he healed a woman of an infirmity that she had for 18 years.

We say, is there any great assurance that that gives me about him?

Christ would say tremendous because he would also remind us that this miracle of healing that he performed assures you and me that he was the sinless one.

He was absolutely without fault.

He did not even violate the Sabbath day.

Oh, there was quite a stir in that congregation that day after Jesus had healed the president of the congregation.

Oh, there was an arrogance about him.

He didn't address Jesus and say you just worked.

You profaned the Sabbath.

You went and laid your hand on the head of this woman.

And therefore when healing her you have worked and you have broken the Sabbath.

In utter disdain he turns to the congregation and he says to them, you know that there are six days in which you ought to work.

If you want to get healed come around in those days and not on the Sabbath.

No wonder Jesus turned to him and he said, you hypocrite.

Aren't you one with any one of you and again don't you do this every Sabbath.

You unloose your rocks or your donkey and you take them from the fall and you give them water.

You should not hide.

Therefore this woman who was a daughter of Abraham who has been held in the vices of Satan for 18 years, you mean to say that I should not heal her?

Oh, it wasn't an absolute necessity now was it?

If she was been for 18 years she could have gone another day.

Do we mean to say that only that which was necessary?

What was the spirit of the Sabbath?

God had said that man should not work.

God worked six days and he rested on the Sabbath.

And it was to be a wonderful day.

But in the Word of God Jesus always reminded that God never said that you can't be merciful, you can't be compassionate, you can't be kind on the Sabbath.

In fact God's Word says I would have mercy rather than sacrifice.

Mercy comes first.

There's never a closed season on mercy.

Don't ever let the idea of no work interfere with you showing mercy and kindness.

Christ never violated the Sabbath.

I've heard even Christian ministers say that he violated the Sabbath.

He did not.

Christ kept the Sabbath in its entirety.

He absolutely fulfilled the very spirit of it.

He showed mercy and kindness as he did here in Korea.

And therefore I see his sinlessness.

He had to show it by, and this brings comfort in the day of illness in your life and mine, that we can say to ourselves, my Christ was a perfect Christ.

And when he kept the Ten Commandments he could keep them for me because he never sinned.

He never thought an evil thought.

He never spoke an evil word.

He never did an evil deed.

He was the sinless one.

This miracle of healing on the Sabbath.

He never broke the Sabbath.

They don't let anybody ever tell you that he did.

Jesus would call upon you and me in this miracle of healing to thank and to praise him.

And we may say, why?

That happened nearly 2,000 years ago.

Where's there any assurance that that gives me about him?

Where's there any comfort to me in my days of illness or in the days when I am well?

And Christ would remind you and me this, that that miracle, the very fact that it assures us that he was no less than God and a perfect human being, which therefore further assures us that on the cross Jesus did provide deliverance from eternal death
and the gift of eternal life for all men.

When we look at him and we say, who was he that performed this miracle of healing?

Here in some synagogue, some place in Korea, he was no less than God, as Scripture had said in the Bible.

God as Scripture had said he would be attested by his miracles.

He was no less than a perfect man without sin.

And therefore you and I can say to ourselves, there is my assurance that when he died on the cross, God died.

When he bore hell and damnation in my stead, he brought it for the entire human race if there will have been 1,000 trillion human beings.

He did it for all men because he was no less than God.

And when again on that death on Calvary, he bore hell and damnation for all men, he merited a righteousness for the entire human race because he was through God and he was the sinless man.

This is comfort in the day of illness.

This is comfort in each day of your life and mine.

No wonder Christ would say, thank and praise me that one day it was on a Sabbath to be sure that I heal a woman that was bent over double for 18 long years.

You say, where is there any great assurance?

Why this is assurance that I see in this.

The very fact that he was able to heal her, we are told that she was suffering with an evil spirit.

Jesus said, in the bonds of Satan, some say now you're going to talk about demon possession, aren't you?

Yeah, we're going to talk about devils and we're going to talk about the fallen angels.

There are those that say now in our 20th century enlightenment, we don't believe in Satan.

We don't believe in the fallen angels.

We don't believe that demons ever possessed human beings.

This was their way of looking at illness.

And then you'd have to say, well then Christ adjusted himself to that and he became part of that falsehood.

Then Christ didn't know everything.

Then Christ was not the Savior.

And then Christ was just a person of his kind.

He was ignorant of something.

But Dr.

Luke is the one who records this and he was the noble physician and he records other miracles of healing when he doesn't mention demon possession.

What does it all mean?

On the basis of Scripture this, Satan is a real person, an angel of God.

And Satan, you know, turned against God and others rebelled.

And there is an eternal animosity between the fallen angels.

And it seems that when Jesus came, it was when all the forces of hell tried to do everything in order to prevent Calvary and eternal life.

And in Jesus' day, Satan or the fallen angels could take possession of someone's body or of their mind.

In this case, an evil demon had taken possession of this woman's body and had brought again this paralysis that she simply couldn't stand up.

And yet our Christ, he turned and said, Woman, you're rid of your infirmities.

Here is the assurance that Christ is bigger than Satan and the fallen angels and all the powers of hell.

Saint Paul was a brilliant man.

He wasn't an ignoramus.

He believed in Satan.

He believed in the fallen angels.

Remember he said about that, he said, We wrestle not against flesh and blood.

This isn't our problem.

We wrestle against principalities, against powers, against rulers of the darkness of this present world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Paul said, We're wrestling against Satan and we're wrestling against the forces of hell.

This is the battleground.

And oh, what assurance in the day of your illness in mind or in any day of our life to know this, that because Christ has absolute power over Satan, Satan can never bring any illness in your life and mind without the permission of Christ.

He simply can't do it, nor can he ever snatch you and me away from our Christ and Lord.

He simply can't do it.

Paul was able to say, For I reckon that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other feature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus.

This is comfort in the day of illness.

When you and I may be unconscious and we may not know who we are, to know this, that we have a Christ who has absolute supreme power, that Satan can never grasp your soul and mind and never snatch it for hell.

It just can't be done.

This is comfort because one day over in Korea was on a Sabbath day, Jesus, he healed a woman who was possessed of a demon.

Christ showed who was boss that day, even as he is boss today.

We said to ourselves, Why should I thank and praise him for a miracle of healing that was performed by him about 2,000 years ago over in Korea, some place over in some synagogue?

But it's recorded in the Word of God that you and I may say, Here is assurance that I have because of that miracle.

Here is comfort that I have regardless of the day in which I live or the illness that comes.

It gives you and me this assurance and we realize this miracle.

This was factual.

This was a historic thing.

This took place.

This wasn't a fairy tale.

This wasn't saga.

This wasn't myth.

This was fact.

This was something that occurs.

I have said, How in the world would you say it in the other words if it, again, if you don't believe that it took place, how would you say it if it did?

And it gives us this assurance that Christ in healing that woman, has absolute power over any disease barring none that may come in your life and mine.

What an assurance we have in Jesus Christ.

We say sometimes the illness that comes to us or to our loved ones, we talk about it being hopeless.

What do you mean hopeless?

There is no sickness.

There is no disease that is ever hopeless from the standpoint of Jesus Christ.

He showed it that day over in Korea.

There was a woman bent over double for 18 years and couldn't straighten up.

There was a woman possessed of a devil.

But Jesus Christ said, You're loosed.

You're rid of it.

Who has all power?

Do you know of any disease that's bigger than his power?

I don't.

It isn't cancer.

It isn't heart trouble.

I don't care what you and I can name.

There is nothing that stands as an absolute power and that Jesus cringes at and says, I'm hopeless in this situation.

This is the assurance that you and I have.

Let me tell you that brings comfort then.

It brings this comfort that in your prayer life and mind to him.

We ought never to pray in a spirit of hopelessness to be despondent and to say he can't do anything.

Isn't it a comfort to know we've got a Christ to whom we can turn who has all power in heaven and in earth, who can heal any disease, who can do anything?

This is comfort.

This is consolation.

This is peace to a Christian even in this 20th century.

We say, Where is there any assurance that I should thank and praise him that my heart should be glad because he healed a woman bent over for 18 years?

Well, Jesus reminds you and me that it also, this miracle of healing gives us this assurance.

They heal the sick.

We've got to have faith healers and it's a big day isn't it in the church?

Faith healers.

I wonder if we fail to realize why the miracle of healing in the first place.

Christ did not heal every sick person in Palestine.

The great reason for healing was this, to attach to him.

That's eternal life.

They turned their backs on Jesus when he didn't heal them or feed them.

They didn't want salvation.

If you want to get a crowd, it isn't the gospel teaching that brings the crowd today.

Go out and be a faith healer.

That's what brings it.

People don't care about life and salvation.

Yet Christ came to die for that.

This thing of healing.

I don't believe in faith healers.

Christ has done all of the miracles that we need and they're recorded and skipped atop by his resurrection.

We don't need one more miracle of healing.

I don't believe in faith healers.

I believe faith heals to be sure.

I believe that my prayer to Jesus Christ when I'm healed is just as effective as your prayer or the prayer of any man.

I don't need a faith healer.

He doesn't have any more power in prayer than you or I do.

We've both got the same Christ.

Something's happening.

Until I can see a faith healer and that I can see a person with a broken hip, you and I know it's broken and see it healed immediately, I don't believe in faith healers, nor do I go or would I go to one.

Because there's always an answer, if you didn't get healed, your faith isn't strong enough.

And then you and I said, if my faith isn't strong enough to heal me, my faith isn't strong enough to save me, then God knows you and I are in trouble.

Jesus Christ has given us every miracle of healing that we need.

The church had better realize there's something bigger than healing.

Oh, sure, he heals.

Because Christ gives us this assurance that he always heals you and me and our realnesses or he gives us something better than healing.

You may say to me, this morning, preacher, what's better than having health?

May I ask you very simply to be saved, to be rescued from hell, to go to heaven.

That's better.

That's eternal.

That's far greater.

And you see, sometimes when he doesn't heal your body and mind, he does it for one reason that you and I can learn to evaluate, but we can see that there is a difference.

Rather strange that he healed this woman.

Rather strange though a man like St.

Paul, the greatest missionary that ever aired, he had an illness, whatever it was, we don't know, a thorn in the flesh, and he constantly, three times he said, I prayed to God to take it away, and God's answer was no.

He died with it.

You say, I wonder why.

Wasn't Christ the Son of God?

Paul died with it.

Remember when Jacob was up again, when Jacob was over at the book of Jobuch, and when Christ, before his incarnation, wrestled with him, and Jacob said, I want my sins forgiven, and Christ forgave him his sins and then touched his hip and gave him
a crippled body.

He lived from that time on.

Forgotten it?

Rather strange how differently he deals with us.

Jesus always heals unless he gives us something better.

You say, what better preacher will eternalize?

Patience to learn again to trust.

So that even in illness, we begin to see Christ through a tear.

That's only when he begins to appear beautiful.

When you begin to see heaven through a tear, that's when that blessing for which God died begins to have value.

This text this morning, you will forgive some personal comments, means a great deal to me, for two reasons.

The one is this.

This is the first text that I had as a student in the seminary that I preached on in my first year at Kappa University.

In your first year, your professor hands you a text, and this is the one you preach on, I shall never forget it.

It was on this woman, bent down with a spirit of infirmity.

I was scared to death to stand in God's pulpit before my classmates and my professor to conduct a church service.

I remember writing to my mother and telling her I'm going to preach.

It was on a Tuesday, I recall.

I remember the answer I got back from her.

She said, I'll be in the living room.

I'll be in my chair, and I'll be with my wife, and I'll be real quiet, and I'll be praying for you.

I'll never forget that as long as I live.

That's one reason why I like this text.

Another, that during the end of my sophomore year at Kappa University, I had a great bow with a kidney stone, and I needed healing.

I was told by the doctor that there was a great possibility that a kidney was destroyed and that I would leave my left kidney.

I did a lot of praying that night.

I wanted to be a minister, and I said to the Lord, well, if it's going to be a ministry with only one kidney, I hope I'll have the strength because it's a rigorous thing in the ministry.

Jesus was good.

The stone was removed, and I still have those two kidneys today.

It's been a tremendous blessing, 41 years in the ministry.

I don't deserve it, but I've never missed a Sunday in 41 years because of illness, or I've been sick like you have.

I preached some Sundays, and I thought I couldn't stand up.

I've held myself up occasionally, but I always said as long as I can stand up and I can talk, if it's my time to preach, I'm going to preach.

God's been good.

What a privilege it's been, may I say, for nearly 35 years to be your shepherd when illness has come to you, to be able to point you to the Christ, the one that has all power.

He is the Savior.

And when again illness has come to your loved ones, then death came to be able to comfort you in the assurance that it's through death, he who has all power to grand healing, that he takes our loved ones to eternal life.

It's been a joy.

It's been a privilege, and I certainly thank you that I could be your shepherd for nearly 35 years and walk the glory road with you.

And in your illness, to come and bring comfort that we could pray together to the Christ of all power, that when you could see him through a tear in your illness, you saw that he was beautiful.

But we have been able to walk the glory road together, to sing together about him, beautiful Savior, King of Creation, Son of God and Son of Man, truly I'd love thee, truly I'd serve thee, light of my soul, my joy, my crown.

This is the Christ that you've given me the privilege of telling you about.

I thank you.

Amen.

The peace of God which passeth all human understanding, keeping the nights, your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus until life everlasting.
