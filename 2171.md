## Transcript
 Dr.

Schillinger, Dr.

Hollinson, members of the Emanuel congregation, and friends and visitors.

So that we may all understand each other, my name is Paul Smith, and by the generosity of you, the members of this congregation, I am your senior elder.

Today is a very, very memorable occasion in the history of Emanuel Lutheran Church.

Almost never has it been a fact that two ministers serve a congregation consecutively for a total of 56 years, 28 years each, and both ministers be living and able to be present in that same church to celebrate and recognize the occasion.

This fact has been accomplished today by Drs.

Hollinson and Schillinger, and it is now a part of the history of Emanuel.

Dr.

Schillinger began in 1909, and Dr.

Hollinson in 1937.

This one-half century plus six years is almost two-thirds of the total life of Emanuel, which is 91 years old, as Reverend Hollinson has already pointed out this morning.

Established in 1874, in those 35 years preceding, there were only three pastors, as you've been told, Rev.

Martin Heck, A.

L.

Nicholas, and William Stellhorn.

This shows that in this congregation, the ministers from the very beginning, which has grown through the years, that there has been unusual stability, cooperation, goodwill, steadfastness, and continuity of purpose in the promotion of God's
Word, which not many churches can equal.

The result is that now Emanuel is the largest Lutheran church in our Ohio district, and many of us believe that it is the best and best organized in the district.

To pause for a few minutes, give recognition and thanks to those two living ministers, was thought of several years ago by Robert Byrd.

The seed's zone, and upon suggestion, your vestry approved the idea unanimously.

Your committee composed of Mr.

Byrd, Mr.

Ralph Barkley, Mr.

Carl Camel, and myself, chose not to change a word in the draft of the letter written by Mr.

Byrd, on behalf of Emanuel, a grateful congregation, to our two outstanding ministers, to which hundreds of you have already subscribed your name, and if you have not done so, sheets for your signatures are at the entrances of the church today,
and will be there next Sunday.

The letter of appreciation from a grateful congregation reads as follows.

November 14, 1965, to the Reverend M.

E.

Hollinson, D.

D.

,and the Reverend J.

W.

Schillinger, D.

D.

Seldom, possibly never before, has the congregation had the opportunity to recognize 56 years of pastoral service shared equally by two men of God, and had both of them present to participate in the occasion.

Twenty-eight years of service to Emanuel congregation is only one of the several distinctions you share.

Both of you have Doctor of Divinity degrees from Capital University.

Both of you personally led this congregation in historic building projects.

Both of you have headed the Ohio District of the American Lutheran Church.

Dr.

Hollinson briefly is its acting presiding officer, and Dr.

Schillinger for many years as its president.

You, Dr.

Schillinger, will remember the recognition that parted you by a grateful congregation when you concluded 28 years of service to us, just 28 years ago.

We count it our excellent fortune to have you with us while we accord Dr.

Hollinson equivalent honor for having equaled your unusual term of service to our church.

You, Dr.

Hollinson, are especially honored on this occasion not only for years of service, but for building so effectively upon the foundations Dr.

Schillinger helped to prepare for your coming.

The volume and quality of your personal accomplishments, both in the spiritual and secular areas of the church, are beyond listing, but a typical few must be mentioned.

Confirmation of more than 2,200 children and adults.

Baptism of more than 2,500 infants and adults.

Accession of more than 3,100 new members.

As many as 4,500 pastoral calls in a single year.

Possibly 100,000 calls in 28 years.

Steadily rising attendance to a 1964 Sunday morning average of 1,023.

Radio broadcast of 1,189 consecutive Sunday worship services.

Leadership in such projects is our church expansion.

Air conditioning, new organ, and parking lot programs.

We gratefully recognize also your outstanding service to the American Lutheran Church, especially to its board of publications over a period of many years.

And your basic contribution to the spread of the gospel in your work, in your book, is it true.

God has richly blessed both your efforts and those of Dr.

Schillinger.

We are most grateful to him and to both of you for the privilege of being a part of the vineyard in which both of you have labored so many years.

Sincerely, your congregation, Emanuel and friends.

Now it is my very great personal privilege and honor to present to you, Dr.

Schillinger, a copy of this letter of appreciation from and thanks from a very grateful congregation.

Dear people, members of the Lutheran Church, it certainly has been a great joy for me to meet with you here this morning.

I have enjoyed the service immensely.

Now since in this service we are emphasizing old age, 28 years and 28 years and 56 years, and we're emphasizing old age.

And it seems to me that under these conditions it would be a good thing to ask, what is the oldest part of our Christian service?

Do you know?

I wonder how many of this large audience here this morning could tell us which is the oldest part of our Christian service.

Well I'll tell you the benediction.

God gave that benediction to Moses.

The children of Israel were still in the wilderness.

They had not reached the promised land.

And God came to Moses and said, tell your brother Aaron, Aaron was the priest, the high priest.

And telling him, God said, when he dismisses the congregation always to say, the Lord blessed thee and keep thee, the Lord made his face shine upon thee and gracious unto thee, the Lord looked up his countenance upon thee and did thee peace.

Do you know how old that is?

Nearly 4,000 years old.

And still we all have that every Sunday in our service.

And I'm afraid that none of us fully realize what it means.

The Lord blessed thee and keep thee.

How can the Lord bless poor sinful people?

Why for Christ's sake?

Because Jesus died for them on the cross, took their sins away, and God forgives them all of their sins for Jesus' sake.

So in that benediction we have something about the grace of God.

That if we come to God's Son in faith, that thereby we get the forgiveness of all of our sins.

Then in that benediction we are told that God finds great joy.

The Lord looked up thy, his face among thee and grant thee peace, great joy.

And then God calls upon all of us to join in that joy.

The long-faced Christian is not the ideal with God at all, but the joyful Christian is.

Rejoice over that grace of God.

Rejoice that our sins are all forgiven for Christ's sake.

Rejoice that you are God's people, that you are permitted to come together Sunday after Sunday in the house of God.

And remember when you do this, that the oldest part of the service, nearly 4,000 years old, is the benediction.

That'll make the benediction different, won't it?

Yes, why I'm afraid there are a lot of us who regard the benediction as a sort of a freeness to the service, and that's all.

It's time to wake up the baby and get on the baby's jacket.

It's time for the men to reach down and pick up their hat and get ready to go.

And as soon as the last word is said, we're ready to go, and we look upon that benediction as a sort of a freeness.

The ending.

Now let's get over that.

Let's realize that we have in that benediction the oldest word of our whole liturgy, that it came from the lips of God to Moses, that it was given to Aaron the priest, and since that day, not quite 4,000 years ago, that benediction has always held
its place in the Christian service.

Now here we are today.

We've had a wonderful service.

All has been very lovely.

Now you will notice also at the close of this service, the benediction, that ancient form.

So let us do that, and henceforth let every service be ended on our part with the benediction, understanding it, gratified by it, just as well as the empty words.

Now personally I thank you very sincerely for inviting me to this service and letting me also greet you this way.

May God bless you for it.

Be with you.

Amen.

And now, Dr.

Hollinson, it is my very, very great personal pleasure and privilege to have this opportunity to present to you the original of this letter of appreciation and thanks from a grateful congregation, Emanuel Lutheran Church, Marion, Ohio.

Thank you, Judge Smith.

I think I have brought my message to you today.

It is my heart's desire, if it's God's will, that I may continue the privilege of serving you to be a good minister of Jesus Christ.

We know now how long ministries may last.

God calls by death.

God calls in mysterious ways.

It has been a privilege to be the shepherd of the flock, and it is a joy to bring you the word of God every Sunday.

Thank you, Dr.

Schillinger, for being here.

It's been a privilege to have you and to have you speak words to this congregation.

And again, if you're willing to put up with me, I can assure you it will be a privilege for me to put up with you.

God bless you.
