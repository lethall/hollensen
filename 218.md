## Synopsis

## Transcript
 Dear Christian friends, grace, peace, and mercy be unto you from God our Father and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

The text which we have chosen for this ordination anniversary occasion you will find in the 21st chapter of John's Gospel beginning with verse 15.

So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of John, loveth thou me more than these?

He said unto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

He said unto him, Feed my lamb.

He said to him again the second time, Simon son of John, loveth thou me.

He said unto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

He said unto him, Feed my sheep.

He said unto him the third time, Simon son of John, loveth thou me.

Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Loveth thou me.

He said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things.

Thou knowest that I love thee.

Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girded thyself, and walketh whither thou wouldest.

But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shalt gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.

This state he signifying by what death he should glorify God.

When he hath spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.

Now, O Lord, in this hour of worship, give us a word for our hearts, and hearts for thy word.

Amen.

Pastor and Mrs.

Basler, Dr.

and Mrs.

Hollinson, members of the families, Emanuel Congregation, and friends.

This is one of those extremely rare occasions that we certainly would not have wanted to miss for anything.

It isn't often that we have the opportunity to be present for a double ordination anniversary, the first son of a congregation celebrating his 50th ordination anniversary, and then the pastor of the congregation, his 35th.

We certainly pray God's richest blessing upon these who are celebrating today, that as the years go on, they may continue to experience the blessing of God in their lives, and that God may bless many people through them.

It has not been my privilege to know Pastor Basler so well.

We have met him since we were in the Ohio District office the last couple of years.

I've learned to like him very much and to appreciate the work that he has done.

He served mostly in the Eastern District of the church.

He served in the Michigan District for a time, but just before we were privileged to serve there, so we were denied the privilege of meeting him then.

I was thinking back when I first became aware of the name of Martin Hollinson.

He may not remember it.

There must have been a time after he came here to your congregation that you thought about updating your constitution.

And Dr.

Hollinson wrote to a number of congregations that were of similar size and asked for copies of the constitutions of these congregations.

And it was that way that he wrote to me, I don't think we helped you any by the material I sent you at that time.

I think we could do better today.

But this was my first contact with the name of Martin Hollinson at Marion, Ohio.

Then when we returned from Iowa in 1952 to Ohio, then it was my good fortune to get to know Dr.

Hollinson much better.

We served for a good many years on the Executive Committee of the Ohio District.

He served for a time as the acting President of the Ohio District, and he was always a man to whom one would look for counsel and guidance in times of crisis.

If we had problems with which we were confronted, we could always expect good counsel from the pastor at Marion.

And among other things, we learned also that he was a man, a dedicated pastor, dedicated to the service of God, and I think in love with his congregation.

Because he had opportunities to occupy the positions which we hold today, but he preferred to be the pastor of your congregation here in Marion.

I would say a true shepherd who loved the flock of God.

And so it is indeed a privilege for us to be here with you, a double pleasure.

Also our first opportunity to worship with you in your very fine sanctuary.

Whenever an anniversary is celebrated, I think we always go back, at least in our minds, to some of the things that have happened, the history of the past.

We always look back on an anniversary and take a much briefer look into the future.

One of the first books that was given to me as a gift by a pastor was entitled, In the Master's Vineyard.

It was written by an old pastor of the former Iowa Synod, which is part of the former American Lutheran Church, by a pastor Augustine who was up in Wisconsin somewhere, and it was a story of his life.

It was a fascinating story.

More interesting because it was true than many of the novels which you might have an opportunity to read.

And as I thought of this anniversary occasion, if we could put together the 85 years of service to the Lord and His church, which is represented by these two men whom we're honoring today, what a fascinating story that would be.

A story of activities, of work, of trials, of disappointments, disillusionments, failures, frustrations, with some successes and satisfactions thrown in for reward.

Actually the life of a pastor, a conscientious pastor, is as interesting as any novel could possibly be.

And so I would like to use as our theme today the romance of the ministry.

In the life of a pastor there is mystery, there is wonder, there are all the elements that make for an interesting story.

However, I would seem to be doing the wrong thing if today we spent this time from this pulpit just talking about the life and activities of these two pastors.

That's why we chose the text which we chose.

It wouldn't surprise me if Dr.

Hollinson or Pastor Batler on occasion might have used this text for an ordination service.

And so maybe you can think back to the time that you were ordained.

When the romance began for you in the ministry, we hope and trust that it was built on love.

As a pastor who has counseled many a young couple that have come to you, perhaps you have asked them the question, Do you love each other?

Do you really want to be married?

Is this something that you have to do in order to be happy?

This is the kind of a question that ought to be asked of young men before they take their vows for the holy ministry.

Do you really love the Lord?

Peter, you may remember, had denied that he knew his Lord on that Thursday evening in Holy Week.

He had done it three times and this is probably the reason that Peter was asked three times by the Lord, Do you love me?

But only the first time he asked, Do you love me more than these?

Scholars feel that there is a different possible interpretation for this question.

Generally we have thought that Jesus was asking, Do you love me more than these other disciples and your brethren over here?

Dr.

Barclay thinks that maybe this took place on the shores of the Sea of Galilee and that Peter was probably standing there next to the boats and maybe even leaning a hand on one of the boats because they'd just come in from fishing.

And that Jesus asked, Do you love me more than these material earthly things?

The things that go to make a living?

Because just a few days before that Peter had said, I'm going fishing.

And it left Jerusalem, the place where they had been following with the Lord.

And this question it seems to me is very apropos.

Particularly when we're talking to people about the ministry.

Do you love me more than these earthly concerns, the material things that might accrue to you if you were in some other business?

The saint of Dr.

L.

H.

H.

U.

when he was pastor of St.

Paul's in Toledo said one time, he figured that he made a contribution every year of about $22,000 to the work of the church.

And he explained it this way.

He said, I was a graduate of Kappa University and while I was there he said I met a number of young men with whom I was fairly even in talent.

And he said, those friends of mine are earning around $25,000 a year these days.

I'm getting three.

This was back in the late 20s.

He said, so I figure that I'm making a contribution of about $22,000 a year.

But he said, I'm happy to do it.

I wouldn't exchange my position with that of others for anything in the world.

He loved the Lord more than these earthly material advantages that he might have had in some other profession.

It is important that a pastor love his Lord.

Not all men perhaps enter the ministry because they love the Lord.

For some, the ministry is an opportunity to get away from a rather sordid environment to which they would be committed, perhaps for the rest of their lives, if they stayed where they were born and raised.

For others, the ministry is a status symbol, although far from what it once was.

Pastors aren't put on pedestals anymore as we once thought they should be placed on pedestals.

And perhaps it is better this way.

Pastors and people are together and they're not separated, one from the other, except when we're in church together.

Then there are people who I think have gone into some area of church work because the church makes at least a very sizable contribution to the education of a minister.

The pastor actually pays very little when you consider the total of his educational costs.

And one man said that to me one time.

He said, this is the cheapest education I can get.

We may say parenthetically that even though he hadn't intended to serve in the parish, he is serving in the parish and he's happy serving in the parish.

The Lord led him from his first goal to a love for him and his church.

And of course there are always those who think in terms of seeing different parts of the country.

I'm sure that when Pastor Baseler, Jr.

,that's here today, graduated from seminary he had no idea that he would be seeing as much of the country as he has already seen.

I said one time when I was going to an ordination service to a young boy, I said I'm on my way to Scotland.

And his eyes brightened and he said, I think I'll enter the ministry too.

But when I told him it was Scotland, South Dakota, a little crossroads village, he changed his mind.

But it is true that a pastor can see different parts of the country, different parts of the world, because he is a minister and he may be called to service in different areas.

But the proper basis for serving the Lord is not what it will bring to me, but my love for Jesus Christ.

There may be times when the best of ministers forget and aren't motivated by this deep, all-consuming love for Jesus Christ.

Because as Pastor Herbert Lobert, the pastor at Bellevue, Ohio said one time in a conference sermon, pastors are people too.

And there are times when the old Adam sort of raises his head and gets the upper hand for a little while in the lives of dedicated men.

But the proper basis is love.

Jesus used three different words.

He thought of the love that sometimes is associated with passion.

Then Peter answered, you know that I love you, but Peter used a word which we would translate with Philip as I'm your friend.

But Jesus asked the question using the word for the highest type of possible love, not the kind that implies an emotional attraction, infatuation.

Liking, as we like to popularly put it, but rather that of being drawn and committed in good will.

This is what he asked of Peter, and Peter wouldn't say any more than this, Lord, I'm your friend.

And that means so much, because if you can honestly say, Lord, I'm your friend, then no matter where you are, no matter what may be happening, you will stand by your friend.

Because a friend is one who will be with you when you're in need, not only when it's sunny and beautiful outside, not only when the going is good.

I hope that we can all say that to the Lord this morning.

I am your friend.

Here are two who have said it.

They've said it again and again, not necessarily with words, but they've said it with a dedication of their lives.

And that leads me to the second point.

The romance of the ministry based on love finds its fulfillment in service.

This took place, the story of our text, shortly after the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to his disciples up in the Sea of Galilee.

Peter said, Lord, I'm your friend.

And what was Jesus' response?

He didn't just pat Peter on the shoulder and say, Peter, I knew the other night you were scared to death, and you didn't mean to deny me.

You were just frightened.

I knew you didn't mean it.

This wasn't Jesus' response.

To the response, Lord, I'm your friend, I love you, comes the word, feed my land, feed my feet.

It's so easy to say, I love the Lord.

One Sunday morning while I was pastor in Dayton, Ohio, I didn't very often do this, but somehow or other I decided I was going to do that that morning.

I got in the pulpit and I said, would everyone that's in the audience please raise your hands if you love the Lord?

And I looked over the audience and I think it was unanimous.

In the back view that morning, I met a young man who I knew didn't go to church.

He just happened to be visiting there with a couple other boys.

He raised his hand with the rest of them.

I don't know whether he knew what it meant when he said with the others, I love the Lord.

It's easy to say.

I suppose if we ask you here this morning, do you love the Lord?

Every one of you would say, yes, I love the Lord.

How do we know?

How do we show it?

Some of you here I know are married.

A husband has said to his wife, I love you.

Has your wife ever said to you, then prove it?

Maybe it's been the other way around too.

But the word comes to easily.

It comes to easily from us.

I love the Lord.

Jesus says, feed my lamb, feed my sheep.

I will see whether you love me in your relationship to my people.

I thought it was a beautiful soul that we listened to a moment ago.

It reminded me of the story told by Leo Tolstoy of a Martin Ovech, a shoemaker in Russia.

I think of this story every time I see the picture which we call Grace, the old man sitting at a table with meager fare before him.

Here was this, and I want to tell this very briefly, here was this shoemaker in his little shop.

He had very little.

When he was in his shop, he lived in the same room, he would cook himself a little cabbage soup.

And then after he'd eaten, he'd take his Bible and he'd read.

And this one evening he fell asleep with his Bible in his lap.

And he dreamed, he dreamed that the Lord said to him, Martin, tomorrow you're going to see me.

And he was happy.

Now he didn't believe in dreams, but he couldn't get it out of his mind.

So the next morning when he went to work, opened his shop, he kept looking out of the window to see if perhaps he would see the Lord.

He was out sweeping a little of the dirt and stuff that gathered in front of his shop from the sidewalk.

He saw a man leaning against the light post, shivering.

He wasn't dressed for this cold winter weather that they have in Russia.

So he invited the man in and he said, look, he said I've got a quote here that you can have.

Maybe it'll help keep you warm.

He went to do a little work and he looked out of the window and there he saw a woman with a little baby.

The baby was crying.

They seemed to be cold.

He invited them into his shop.

He said you can warm yourself over here and maybe you can feed the little baby.

Sent her on her way a little later on.

Then as the afternoon began to wane, he was disappointed.

He hadn't seen the Lord.

He saw a little boy run up to a lady who was trying to sell some apples to make a living and he grabbed an apple and ran away and started to taunt her about it.

And Martin couldn't see this so he went out and chased the boy and he brought the boy back and made him put the apple back into the lady's basket.

And she was ready to have him taken over by the police and he helped make peace between this woman and this little boy and sent them on their way, the boy carrying the basket for the elderly lady.

The story ends by saying that that evening after he'd had his cabbage souped, he sat down in his chair and he took his Bible and he went to sleep again reading his Bible.

And then he dreamed and the Lord said, three times I appeared to you today.

Didn't you know me?

And with that he awakened and he looked down on the Bible before him and he saw in print what we heard sung to us.

In as much as he had done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto me.

Do you love the Lord?

You show it by loving his brethren, by relating to his people.

We serve him by serving others.

A pastor is not just a builder of congregational morale.

He is not just a promoter of the common culture.

A pastor is the ambassador, the representative of Jesus Christ, going about his community, going through his parish like Christ, helping, counseling, lifting up, encouraging, bringing both law and gospel to people.

And the more varied the pastor's life and service, the greater his own satisfaction and the fulfillment of his ministry.

Who can have served thirty-five years or fifty years in the ministry without having hundreds, thousands of people with whom his life has come into helpful, meaningful contact?

What a glorious fulfillment it is for a man who is a minister of Jesus Christ.

But the crown of glory comes at the end.

Those who have brought many to Jesus shall shine like the stars.

There have been hardships on the way.

There has been much opposition.

Words aren't always accepted.

When I think of the time 1916 when Pastor Baker started his ministry, those were war years, not pleasant, easy, happy years.

He has seen much of hardship through his ministry.

When I think of the time when Pastor Hollinson began, 1931, how well we can remember those days.

That year we went into our second parish.

Sometimes we got our salary, sometimes we didn't.

If the money came in, all right.

But it easily didn't.

Insufficient amounts.

And when a church had a debt, these men weren't about to go to the bank to borrow more money.

People just weren't paid.

The depression of the 30 was a rough time.

A rough time to begin one's ministry.

And yet as you look back upon it, I think we would say a glorious time.

We didn't start with a silver platter.

We didn't start with everything coming our way.

We learned something of what it means to follow the Lord Jesus Christ and to bear the cross after him.

But a good minister doesn't say, if this is what the ministry is, count me out.

I'll do something else.

Here are men who have dedicated their lives to the Lord and they serve him faithfully.

And they may hear the words, well done, good and faithful service.

We don't want them yet to enter into the joy of the eternal reward.

We believe that the Lord still has much work for them to do.

And as a financial counselor said to a pastor who inquired as to what he could do about retirement, he said the first thing I have to say is how can a man of God ever retire?

And as I look at these two men whom we honor, it would be my judgment that they will be men of God as long as they live, wherever they are, friends of the Lord Jesus Christ who will continue to serve him with all and the best that they have.

May God bless you and keep you in that way.

Amen.

And now may the peace of God which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in true faith until life everlasting.
