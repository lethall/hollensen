## Synopsis
Rev Baseler reflects on his ministry.

## Transcript
 Needless to say, this is one of the outstanding days of my life.

Little did I think that such marvelous words and kind deeds would be done in my behalf.

I feel like a Jacob of old who said, I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and all the truths which thou hast shown unto thy servants.

The Lord certainly has blessed me and mine, and we are blessed again today beyond measure, to which I am extremely grateful.

I want to say that 50 years ago, the 18th of June, a little behind time, this was the 17th of July, I took the ordination vow in the old church on a state in Columbia.

Strange to say that the late Reverend William Stellhorn preached the sermon and used the exact text which we heard this morning.

So this was not strange in my ears.

And strange too to say that practically the same message, with variations of course and brought up to date, was preached on that occasion as this morning.

It's marvelous how the Word of God continues on and on.

And I'm very grateful that to that day when Pastor Schillinger and the late Reverend Stellhorn ordained me to the ministry, and all I can say now is with St.

Paul I thank God that he did put me into the ministry and he has blessed me so abundantly.

I want to thank all who were instrumental in bringing this occasion about on my behalf.

The committee headed by Mr.

Paul Satter, and of course the pastor, our good pastor Reverend Hollinson, he has been untiring in his efforts.

And then finally also for his precious and blessed gift from the congregation.

Thank you very, very much.

Thank you, Pastor Dye, sir.

I am very mindful at this point of Dr.

Schillinger.

I suppose a number of you are wondering, was Pastor Schillinger able to be present this morning?

And may I say that he was proudly invited to be here.

He is 85 years of age.

He is celebrating his 62nd ordination anniversary, but the condition of his health was such that it was too dangerous to bring him to the service.

I feel certain he is listening on the air that he is hearing his name mentioned.

It was my good fortune as a minister to follow Reverend Schillinger, as you know, a bit more than 28 years ago.

We observed that anniversary last November when I had completed 28 years as your pastor, and Dr.

Schillinger was here that day, both of us having served this congregation for 28 years each.

Sometimes I feel that it is too long to stay in a congregation as long as I have been with Emmanuel.

And yet I return again to this, that it is God who calls a man into the ministry.

It is God who places him, and therefore it is God's will when a person makes a change.

And thanking you for the gift for this day.

May I say that if in the providence of God it becomes too long in one church, then God will move me, either to another parish or by death, but until of that time his will be done, for God's will is always there.

As regards Pastor Basler, four years ago I received a letter from Pastor Merton and he said, I'm coming home.

And that meant coming back to Emmanuel after having completed 46 years in the active ministry.

Well, Merton came back and we had a nice talk one day and he said, would you like to have me help you?

And I said, I certainly would.

What would you like to do?

Well, he said, I don't want a call.

I don't want to have too much responsibility, but I would like to call on the shut-ins.

I was reared here and I know a number of them.

And I said, well that's just fine.

I'm sure that they would enjoy having you come to see them.

And so there came a happy relationship in the ministry with Pastor Basler saying, I'd like to spend about two afternoons a week calling on the shut-ins.

And that's what he has been doing for the past four years.

It has been a great help and I certainly appreciate that fine service so very much.

And I'm sure you, the members of the congregation, and you the shut-ins, have always been happy to have Pastor Basler call.

Pastor Basler, when realizing that you were not serving a congregation and that if your 50th anniversary were to again be noted that Emmanuel would have that privilege, we sent out letters to your former pastorates, the former congregations,
and I know that you have received a number of congratulatory letters.

I have just a few of them here and I would like to read them especially from the congregation that you serve.

Here is one from Dr.

Harold Clark who is president and from Pastor William Keefer from a congregation that you serve.

Here is the telegram.

The pastor and congregation of Zion Legion Church and Union Telegram reads, Congratulations and greetings in Christ from the Avondale Lutheran Church, primarily in rural, where it was your privilege to grow up as a boy until your 13th year.

And that letter reads in part, Pastor Basler, the members of Trinity Lutheran Church wish to extend our congratulations to you on your 50th anniversary in the ministry.

This is an especially joyful occasion for Trinity because of your close association with our congregation over the years.

May God continue to bless you in your ministry to the people of the Marian area.

And then here is one from your congregation that you served at North Tonawanda, New York, dear Pastor Basler.

It was a great pleasure that the members of St.

Peter's at North Tonawanda received word of the impending 50th anniversary of your ordination into the Lord's ministry.

On behalf of every member of our congregation, I am privileged to extend to you our congratulations on this happy occasion and to wish you and Mrs.

Basler God's blessings.

Sincerely, Heinon Hayes, the president of the congregation.

And here is one from St.

John's Windfall where you have served as interim pastor a number of times, dear Reverend Basler.

The congregation of St.

John Lutheran Church would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and Mrs.

Basler on the celebration of your golden anniversary of ordination into the Lutheran ministry.

This must certainly be a very happy and thankful occasion for the both of you.

What we have seen and heard of your ministry together in this community and others would it should just cause to be proud and humble that you have been called to be both a witness and an example to so many of us of the joy and scaring the good news of God's
loving kindness and mercy shown us in Christ Jesus our Lord.

To have served so long, so well, is a blessing of God in itself both to you and to those with whom you have served and signed by the best be of the Windfall congregation.

And here are words of felicitation and congratulations from the Zion Lutheran Church of Pittsburgh that you also served, dear brother Basler.

Our congregation has taken official recognition of the observance of your 50th ordination anniversary through its president, Dr.

Harold Clark, and the telegram we sent for this occasion.

This letter followed the telegram.

However, as the pastor of the congregation that you once served and as a brother pastor, I would like to add this letter to the many greetings that you will be receiving on this wonderful occasion.

While the completion of the Zion membership has changed considerably since your pastorate here, there are still many among the congregation who remember you as one who faithfully served this flock.

They recall how you stood by them in times of sickness or other adversities and they are most appreciative.

They recognize your sincere faith in Christ as Lord and feel that your witness in this regard gave thanks for their own faith to grow sincerely in Christ, Pastor William Peter.

And brother Basler here is one from Dr.

E.

C.

Fant who is president of our Columbus Seminary, dear Pastor Basler.

Your seminary alma mater joins your many friends in congratulating you on the 50th anniversary of your ordination to the Christian ministry.

These 50 years of service have constituted a real contribution to the work of the kingdom.

The Lord has blessed you with good health at Eventide and you are still serving that Lord.

May the remaining years of your ministry be filled with joy and blessing in His service and in yours for which we spend.

Well then one from Dr.

Yocum, president of Cap University that is addressed to you and also to me, congratulations.

It is a rare occasion when the anniversary of the ordination of two pastors can be celebrated on the same date.

It is a felicitous coincidence that the 50th ordination anniversary of the Reverend Mr.

Basler and the 35th ordination anniversary of the Reverend Mr.

Hansen can be observed on the same Sunday.

Let this be a challenge to young men and boys at Emmanuel Lutheran Church to dedicate themselves to the service of God in the Holy Ministry.

Cap of the university and the Lutheran Theological Seminary eagerly welcome young men preparing for the ministry and rejoice in the faithful service rendered by such graduates as Pastor Basler and Dr.

Hansen.

We join in thanking God for the blessings of the past and in asking His continuing grace for the years ahead.

Gorgely, yours in His service, Harold L.

Yocum.

Just a few Pastor Basler, but again to let you know that you have the sincere good wishes and the prayers and the congratulations of so many people to whom you have ministered in the past and my hope and prayer is that God may continue to grant you good
health, that you may serve and be the pastor of our settings for many years to come.

God bless you.
