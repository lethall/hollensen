## Transcript
 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Let us hear the word of God as we find written in the book of Hebrews, read there in the 12th chapter of the second verse.

Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

O Lord our strength and our Redeemer.

Amen.

Good morning dear friends in Christ Jesus, you who are here in God's house, and you also Christian friends who are worshipping with us this day by means of the radio.

It is good to be here this morning, and I am sure that after the life-giving reigns that God has given us and the sunshine today that all of us are willing to exclaim, this is the day which the Lord has made, we will rejoice and we will be glad in it.

First of all, I truly want to extend my thanks to Pastor Ray for inviting me to be back here in Bespulba today to the members of the Centennial Committee who also issued that invitation.

It is good to be back again.

And as all of us know, today is our homecoming celebration in connection with the 100th birthday of our beloved Emanuel Congregation.

That means that many of you as we know have come from distances, you belonged here at one time, you have come back because you wanted to come home.

You have brought your friends and those of us who have not gone, we are back here again in Emanuel, our spiritual home, and as we know it's a joy to go home, isn't it?

We say there's no place like home.

It's home, sweet home, our spiritual home.

But I wonder, Christian friends, how many of us know that Christ felt the very same way about going home?

In the text that I read from the New Testament book of Hebrews, we find that there the sacred author tells us this about Jesus.

He says this, who for the joy that was set before him, because of the joy of going home, of going back to the Father's house, of going to the heavenly mansions, the writer says he endured the cross, despising the shame.

In other words, Jesus said, I'll go to the cross.

I will take that despisable way of death.

I'll endure anything because after that I'm going home.

I'm going back to the Father.

I'm going back to the heavenly mansions.

And so it seems so appropriate today that you and I, as we adhere on to our homecoming, that we would take the time to thank and to praise Jesus, that he rejoiced to go home, that he was filled with joy, that he was bubbling over with enthusiasm and happiness,
just to go back home.

That we may say to ourselves, well, it's obvious that it was nice for him, it was grand for him to go back to the heavenly mansions, but how about the home that he established here on church for us, our spiritual home, here on earth, this church, and
bringing it right down in your life and mine, here to Immanuel.

What joy is there here?

We may say it's evident that he rejoiced to go home, gave home, but how about the joy that is here?

Is there any fun in coming to church and coming home?

Is there any joy?

And isn't it a tremendous assurance that when we turn to the Word of God, that the Word of God reminds us that Jesus rejoiced to go home, and then that joy that he experienced, it effervesced, it flowed over, it bubbled over, so that there is joy here
in his church here on earth.

Joy is regards him, and also a personal joy because of the wonderful things that he has given us about himself that brings cause for rejoicing and for thanking him.

And so this morning what we want to do is we want to look at our church on homecoming.

We want to say, what is there about Immanuel?

This is our spiritual home here on earth.

What joy do we get when we come here in view of the fact that Jesus rejoiced to go home, before the joy that was set before him, he rejoiced and he said, I'll endure the cross and I'll despise the shame.

In the first place, the Word of God reminds us that Jesus has given us this joy in our spiritual home, Immanuel, the joy of absolute certainty that he was the Messiah, that he was the Savior.

What a homecoming that must have been.

As you and I know, remember he went home on Thursday the fortieth day after Easter.

When he went home, what it must have been when he was seated at the right hand of the throne of God, when the ten thousand times ten thousand angels, one hundred million angels, and the seraphim and the chariot of them stood before the throne and they
sang to him, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory.

What a homecoming that must have been for him, to God and to man.

No wonder he rejoiced and for the joy that was set before him said, I'll endure anything.

It was tremendous, but was it a brush off?

Did he forget us in his spiritual home here on earth?

To be sure, not because.

Seated at the right hand of God in the place of honor, he is one who serves as our great prophet, who has given us the assurance that there's no doubt about it.

He was the Messiah.

He was the Savior to come.

Was he?

Are you and I certain, remembered on Easter Sunday afternoon, the two men on the way to Emmaus, on the day again when they wondered about this Jesus of Nazareth, and there was Cleopas and the other disciples and they were walking along, and they
were filled with depression and sorrow, and a stranger caught up with them and that stranger knows the risen Lord.

And as they walked along, Jesus said to them, why are you so sad?

And they said, well, haven't you been here long enough to know what has happened?

We thought that this Jesus was the Messiah, the anointed one, the Christ that was to come to redeem us and they killed him.

They nailed him to a cross and they walked along and then we are told that Jesus, in the scriptures, he began to tell them about this Messiah and this Christ.

Wouldn't you have liked to have been along that afternoon and to have heard what Jesus said?

I imagine that Christ said, don't you know, men, back in the Word of God, back in the Garden of Eden, when God promised the seed of the woman to Adam and Eve?

And don't you remember that God said, and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel?

Remember when God promised the seed of the woman, the Messiah, and don't you remember, I'm sure that Jesus said to them, that while Abel was to carry it on, came to him his brother, and then God raised up another son that was Seth, and don't you remember
that Seth's descendant was Noah, and don't you remember that God said, Noah from your land will come the Messiah the Savior, and Noah said to his son, blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and don't you remember, I imagine he told him Abraham, when he was
down there in the land of Ur of the Chaldees, and God told him to go to a country that you don't know, and I'll make of you a great nation.

Do you remember when Abraham last then went up into Herod about 600 miles, and down into a strange land of Canaan about 400 miles to the southwest, and God said you're going to be the father of a great nation, and don't you remember how then when he
had the son Isaac that the seed was to come from him, and from his son Jacob, and don't you remember when Jacob went ahead and blessed his sons, that he blessed the fourth son who was Judah, and he said Judah the scepter shall not depart from you until
the law of Judah come from between his feet, until Shiloh come, imagine he told them don't you realize that Messiah you two men, that he was to be from the great nation of Abraham, from the tribe of Judah, and don't you remember that I see that the great
prophet said of him unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God, the everlasting father the prince of peace, of the increase of this government
and peace, there shall be no end to establish it upon the throne of David.

Don't you remember men that he was to come from David's family, and don't you remember that Isaiah said surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, don't you remember that Isaiah said that he would be killed for us, and don't you remember
that David said of him, thou wilt not abandon my soul unto hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy ones to see corruption, don't you remember men that the psalmist has said that he would be raised from the dead, and then suddenly when they came
to Emmaus and they asked him to come in, abide with us because it's toward Eden the day is far spent, and as they sat there and he prayed they looked and it was the risen Lord, he had gone back into the scriptures and had given them all the evidence, sure
I'm the Messiah, I'm the Christ, we say what joy, what fun is there in coming home to church, when Jesus for the joy went to heaven, it's the joy and the indescribable that he was the son, he was the savior, he was the Messiah, and that you and I have this
joy, we'll never be double crossed, we will never be disappointed, we will never stand before God on the day of judgment and never have God say to us, I know you put your faith in Christ, but he wasn't the Messiah, the absolute, absolute assurance
that we may have, in our day as we have been listening to the House judicial committee crying the president, oh damn doesn't it become quite upsetting when intellectual men say what is evidence and they can't come to any conclusion as to what is
bona fide absolute evidence, then to be able to turn to the scriptures and Jesus says here is evidence, I was the Messiah, I the son of Mary born in a manger, I was that Messiah that you and I can say here's the joy, but when I stick my eternal destiny
in him I'll never be disappointed, this is the fun of his spiritual home on earth, he didn't forget us for the joy that was set before him to be sure, but it's a joy that simply effervesces, it bubbles over, the joy also of this, that he has given us this
joy that there is a way of salvation that must have come out of heaven, he sits at the right hand of God, God doesn't have a right hand, you and I know that, God the Father so he's in the place of honor and he sits there as our great high priest and he assures
us again that he in joy wants us to know that he has given us the way to heaven, we may say I wonder what it is, the writer of Hebrews says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame, we say to ourselves what is this way to
heaven, this way of salvation that has to do with the cross, that has to do with something shameful, if you and I lived a billion years and we didn't have a scripture and no one else had the scripture you and I would never know what that meant, we would
never know this way of salvation, it is so unique it must have come out of heaven, but when we turn to the word of God we say he went to the cross despising the shame, what does it mean, think of it, he went to the cross, they put him to death in the most despicable
way that it was possible, the most shameful, the most disgraceful, the most degrading way, if they had killed him honorably they would have beheaded him, but they nailed him to a cross and yet Jesus said I'll go and I'll despise the shame, I'll accept
that shame, that again that humility, that big religion because when it's all over and I'm going to heaven you and I say what did this cross mean, how many of us realize that this cross again it was the greatest reversal in human history, a cross the
most shameful, disgraceful way to die, yet it's become an ornament of grace, our church is a cruciform church, you lay it out in the form of a cross, you ladies wear the crosses in the torment and the men sometimes wear them and we say what is the great
reversal of the cross, here is something that came out of heaven, here is a plan of salvation that if God had not made it known no man would know if this Jesus was God the Son, he again the second person of the trinity came into this world and was born
of the Virgin Mary without sin, he who was the God man of lower value than the human race went to this cross, the shameful, disgraceful cross and he satisfied the justice of his heavenly Father and he bore the guilt and the punishment of hell for you
and me and because he did it he merited a righteousness for the entire world as the weight of God assures us that his was a timeless sacrifice, he was the lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world and that a man that repents and turns to him he
shall have his righteousness, that robe of righteousness whiter than snow and shall have eternal life, this is the joy of joys and the joy of certainty I want to tell you when I entered the seminary there was one thing that dogged me and hounded me
and thank God it did and that was this, when I would look at Christianity the only answer I could get was this Christianity is something you just have to believe that it's true and I couldn't swallow that and I never have if all the truth you have and
the proof of Christianity is this it's a God of believe it that it's true then if you believe anything that makes it true and that didn't go down and I thought I'd never stand in a boat but unless I could stand up and say I know this is true and I found my
answer I've never seen God neither have you but I know this does this certain as God lives I know that Christianity is true why because the way of salvation through Christ and a cross and a resurrection is unknown in any other religion on the face
of the earth all other religions you can spot them that they are human made and they're not from God because man becomes his own savior this is revealed unique truth and it's a tremendous way of salvation God revealed this mystery on that basis I
have the certainty that it's true it hadn't come out of heaven if it didn't come out of heaven how does man ever know this was the joy of my ministry on the Monday night lectures when you brought in the rituals as we look back in the past it was the joy
of telling them what good is comfort what good is joy if this thing isn't true and thank God by his grace as I have looked over the records of 35 years 1986 adults stood at this altar in my ministry that's 14 less than 2 000.

Over a thousand of you by transfer of letter and by reaccomation of faith over 1100 children confirmed there were over 4 000 individuals who were added to the rule of Emanuel congregation to which communicant membership I thank God for that because
of the joy there is joy in the church of Jesus Christ when we preach that gospel and when we proclaim it this is true this is something worthwhile in my book that I published a number of years ago is it true is a compilation of that it was a joy not long
ago tonight we're down in Columbus and we attended Christ Lutheran Church across from the campus I know a number of you've been there pastor Bernal is a minister there and so happened one of the professors from the university was preaching that
Sunday I did not know him I'd never met him when I got to the door pastor Bernal introduced me the first thing he said are you the author of the book is it true yes and he said thank you for that book and he said I've appreciated it's done me a lot of good
and I use it in my classes over in the university it made me feel good if there's anything that has been contributed it is this and I want to shout it to the house top to let anybody ever tell you that there is no absolute proof for Christianity there
is it's the revealed way to heaven that no man would know if God had not made it known it had to come out of heaven this is the joy we say well did Christ bless us all oh no when he went back to heaven and there was joy it's an effervescing it's a simply a bubbly
over thing that has come down and in your church and mine here on earth we say it's a joy to go why because the word of God also assures us that it tells us this glorious thing and this joy that Jesus is patient in his long-suffering as regards those who
scoff at him and those who are unbelievers not long ago one of you just said to me what do you do with a man who's an unbeliever what do you do with a man that comes up and simply in sarcastic tolls he makes fun of everything that's near and dear here he
bless themes the name of God he has news for the church he has good use for Jesus Christ what do you do what do you do what do you do thank God we've got a Christ who is patient and long suffering you know 120 years were given in the days of Noah for them to
repent we got a price that isn't waiting to pounce on somebody who really fuels him and who despises him and curses him in order to damn him not at all there is patience Christ sends affliction at times he sends adversity he does everything that he
can my experience with the unbeliever with the sarcastic individual who has only ridicule is that somewhere along the line some church person is hurting somebody has somehow rather hurt his feelings or has insulted him and again that man is crying
for help and yet here's the joy that when you and I are concerned when we go out of our way and we show a little love then we have this joy of knowing as we look at our Christ he is one with that patience and I like to say this about him my pride is magnificently
insane yes there is an insanity about my lord that is magnificent he is gloriously crazy oh I love him for it you say magnificently crazy yes because he'd a million times rather save than to destroy he says as I live said the lord I have no pleasure
in the death of the wicked but that the man turned from his way and led I have no pleasure he says in the death of the wicked and there again he is so magnificently insane that a million times rather would he save than ever to destroy this is the Jesus
and the joy that you and I find I think of goldsmith the poet who in the deserted village puts it so beautifully when he says and fools who came to scoff remain to pray in my ministry I wonder how many of you are here this morning who when you first went
to church you came to scoff and you came to be a fool and then you remain to pray one of the joys when you understood and went again you saw what it was all about when the church took time to explain to you how foolish not to believe when it stands on invincible
proof on the Christ who rejoiced at the joy that was set before him oh it's a joy therefore because he also gives us this joy in our homecoming church the joy that he will go all out in order to keep you and me in grace he's seated at the right hand of God
surely he is enjoying his home but we are told that he intercedes for us making eternal intercession for us what joy is that the joy that in your life and mine look at the things we do every day that are wrong we're not even conscious of them to know that
he because he pleads has a flow of forgiving grace to you and me that never stops it's like Niagara Falls if you and I were standing under the falls again the water comes there's never a billionth of a second but what again the flowing base is ours that
if whatever we do that is wrong of which we are not aware is forgiven as fast as we do it and how about those sins the weakness when we think things we don't want to think what we know they're wrong and when we say things the time to say I wish I hadn't said
that I didn't want to say it and I didn't want to do this thing and I knew it was wrong are we out of grace to know that we've got a Lord who rejoices to intercede for us that there is a Niagara flow of forgiveness that you and I stand in the same condition
that if you and I have sinned deliberately we've wandered away it's a wonderful thing to know that he welcomes us back and that he forgives and he forgets that he blocks out of his mind anything that you and I have done that is wrong that all we have
left to do then is to forgive ourselves it's a privilege this morning to be able to come to communion and to have the assurance there is forgiveness of sins that you and I can save and we receive that bread and wine that that bread brings us his body
and that wine brings us his blood invisible to be sure that very body and that very blood which on the cross opened up heaven for the world if you and I come as sinners this morning we can say I saw that bread and I saw that wine and I received it therefore
I got his body and his blood and if I'm not saved nobody's saved because that sacrifice that saved the world I find this joy that we can be certain of our salvation even if we don't feel it I know today it's very rampant in the church individuals who
say you've got to feel your religion and fine if you can feel that you can shout your hallelujah fine but I'm talking about the millions who don't seem to be able to shout hallelujah who say do I feel like I'm saved I think of Martin Luther who at times
when he was despondent and when he was depressed in the reformation and when he was asked do you know that you are saved and he would say I don't feel that I'm saved but I know that I am saved because I put my trust in Jesus this is the assurance then we
look at our church and we look at our Christ and we say look at him for the joy that was set before him what was a thrilling thing he said I'll go through anything I'll endure it I'll take the shame and the disgrace because I'm going home but oh it's it's
simply effervesced it's flowed over it's bubbled over down here there is joy if we would find it the joy that he gives us that he always hears us he always answers us when we pray we come in sometimes don't we with heavy hearts and we say to ourselves
oh does he hear a does he answer I prayed so perfectly sometimes we forget how he hears and answers that he tells us it's always best he looks first at your eternal destiny in mind in the light of that he will answer your prayer and mind in the light that
it will help us in our heavenward journey but if it would in any way deter us or it would simply put us on a detour from heaven there are times when he answers prayer with saying no he says no then we sometimes come we say oh the load when he says no is bigger
than I can bear but isn't it a wonderful thing to come into God's house and have him say oh no it isn't bigger than you can bear if you just shift the load a little bit and let me be your yoke bear you put your arm around me and I'll put my arm around you and
we'll shift the load and let me help you then he assures us on the way I've never put a 20 ton load on a ton and a half truck if you've only got a ton and a half truck there'll never be more than a ton and a half load to walk along and you and I may cry he may say
for God's sake stop worrying don't be afraid I'm with you you prayer if there's ever a time to pray it's now and I think of the president of the United States and I'm not here to defend him and I am not here to criticize him but listen if that man is innocent
it is time that you and I as Christians prayed with the throne of grace well that again that 20 ton load is going to be on a 20 ton man and if he's guilty here is the place to pray that he would be led to repentance and faith because even being president
of the United States it isn't worth a man losing his soul over now is it time for prayer and our great country and to know that he hears and that he answers and to know this that the time will come in your life and mind but when we are with him and when we'll
look and we'll say to ourselves he never made any mistake in my life as he guided my life there never was a little bigger than I could bear and it was always with his eye on the crown and we'll thank him someday oh for the joy that was set before him he went
to his home and he he loved to go home and he has left this joy in his church here on earth in the manual your home and my home here on earth the joy that is coming back and that we may share his home with him it must be wonderful in his home in the father's
house the many mansions because he's waiting that you and I can share it with him when we're really happy we want to share it isn't that right he is going to share it with us and he's coming again he's going to raise our bodies from the dead and as you
and I today may mourn some of our loved ones who have fallen asleep in him to know that we shall be reunited with them that they shall be raised up and we shall be with them and we shall be in Jesus home you may say wonder what heaven's like well I don't
know the over I did I come back to this and it's a great comfort what is heaven like heaven's the place where you and I are going to feel at home at home ever been homesick have you ever really been homeless you've never been sick in your life have you
oh just just to be home I think of my father this morning we lived in south Chicago I was just a kid at the time when we moved from south Chicago my father was in the lumber business and he was transferred down to east St Louis 300 miles south of Chicago
because a new yard had been purchased there and he became manager of that yard I was about five years old when we left Chicago we moved down to east St Louis there was no church in east St Louis like the one we had attended the Lutheran church we went
to Zion was like our Emanuel or the ALC now and the church in east St Louis was a Missouri centered Lutheran church my father had been confirmed in old Zion at south Chicago his father and my mother's father were charter members of that church they
had helped build that church and this was the one thing that my father never got over and that was when we left south Chicago that he had to leave Zion Zion was everything to him being at home so we were all communicative members of the Lutheran church
in east St Louis in those days you could be a communicative member not have to be a voting member but he left his membership in Zion in south Chicago when my brother who was older than I was ordained to the Christian ministry we all converged on Zion
in Chicago for the ordination when ordination days came for me we again converged on Chicago when my father was on his deathbed here was the promise of the game said will you see that my earth remains are taken back to Chicago that there will be a church
service in old Zion for me he left his membership there this was home to my dad and we did that there were the final rights and we laid him to rest in Hammond Indiana which is just adjacent to south Chicago we had a member here that I received as a member
of our congregation in due course her husband died and she moved away from Merion she went out west to California wasn't very long before I got a letter and she said will you transfer my membership to a certain Lutheran church which was done and we
wish to god's blessing it was the air so later I received the letter from her again it was a letter written in tears and she said oh I I've done something that oh I wished I had not done I transferred my letter from the manual and I I looked far and near
and I can't find the church like Emanuel Marion that was home to me the place where I found at home and I just can't go on like this could I she said could I bring my membership back to Emanuel Marion and I was sure she had an understanding minister
and I said you go talk to your pastor and I'm sure that he will say all right it wasn't very long before her membership transfer came back she may never come back to Marion again but oh she said there is just no place like Emanuel where I learned to know
Christ and now I feel better that's my home that's where I look forward to going someday some of you have asked me you see me sitting down the pew you said Reverend Allison do you feel at home in the pew well I've got to be honest and answered no I don't
no I don't feel at home in the pew I'm not complaining well I'm not complaining the time came when it was time while my flag was still flowing and it was still unfurled to turn over the tremendous responsibility here to younger and more eager individuals
the pastor rave and the pastor wargenstein that time was there but feeling at home in the pew no and I don't suppose I ever will it's grievous at times again but you feel at home and Emanuel yes you feel it all because I wonder sometimes would you ever
drink in the beauty of the the three windows that we have up here oh when they built this church well I thank God many a time they're beautiful you see Christ for the joy that was set before him went home and here in heaven in the joy what is still over
he is our prophet this window here and the one in the middle is our great high priest still praying for us and they're our king that rules our lives and gives us the joy we're going to be with him we're going to feel at home that's heaven to me when there'll
never be a billionth of a second for what I feel wanted and at home isn't that heaven and here we are on the glory road this is homecoming and it's so good isn't it to be here oh there's no place like Emanuel as far as I'm concerned this is home sweet home
we come in burdened with life loved one's gone and somehow and we realize that he who put the joy went to heaven but there's a joy here it's a little bit of heaven on earth isn't it we can sing here why really what we're doing we are climbing Jacob's ladder
aren't we we are climbing Jacob's ladder we are climbing Jacob's ladder soldiers of the cross every rung goes higher higher every rung goes higher higher every rung goes higher higher the soldiers of the cross sinners do you love my Jesus sinners
