1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,560
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Let us hear the word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,300
as we find it written in Paul's letter to the Romans, the 12th chapter, particularly the 21st verse.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,940
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:34,120
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,100
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,600
In Christ Jesus, our strength and our Redeemer, dear friends,

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,300
you Christian friends who are here in God's house this morning,

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,460
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

10
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,020
Station WMRN was just three years old at the time.

11
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,380
It was then that I had a burning desire to broadcast our Sunday morning worship service

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:22,580
so that the sick and the shut-ins of this community might share in that experience with us.

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,080
We investigated the matter quite thoroughly.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,960
We discovered, first of all, what it would cost to broadcast the service,

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,680
and then to find out also whether the time was available.

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,940
Then, when we realized that this was a possibility,

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,660
it was the late Raymond Roker, a member of our congregation,

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,660
that came to my house early one Monday morning and handed me $500

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,020
and said, let's get started and let's see what happens.

20
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,200
The first broadcast went out from this church on the last Sunday in January in the year 1943.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,320
Today, as you and I know, is the last Sunday in January of the year 1963.

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,640
Twenty years have come and gone since that first broadcast from this Christian congregation.

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,820
And I suppose most of us have been saying, well, what shall we do today?

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Shall we do something different than what we have done in the past twenty years?

25
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,920
And I'm sure the thing for us to do today is to do what we have done each Sunday,

26
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,200
and that is to turn to the Word of God, to pick our text there,

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,420
and to bring the Word of life as it has been brought from this pulpit for the last twenty years.

28
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,560
You recall that we have been taking our text from the twelfth chapter of Romans for the past two Sundays,

29
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,520
and in this twelfth chapter, the Apostle Paul has been reminding us

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,980
that we have seen and we have tasted of the mercies of God,

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,500
and to be sure, we have said that we have, because we have been to Bethlehem,

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
and we have seen the Christ child, the gift of God to this world,

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,860
and we have seen Christ as the epiphany light, not only for the Jewish world,

34
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,400
but also for the Gentile world as well.

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
And then you recall that two weeks ago, Paul said to us,

36
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,100
now that we have seen and we have tasted of the mercies of God,

37
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,520
Paul said, let us be transformed, let us be new men and women,

38
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,540
let us be changed men and women, let our lives be different from the lives of worldly men.

39
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,200
And then last Sunday in the twelfth chapter of Romans,

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,520
Paul was talking to us again about the grace and the mercy of God,

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,020
assuring us that by the grace of God, you and I have been given talents,

42
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,300
different talents to be sure,

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,900
but talents nevertheless.

44
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,980
And so the call last Sunday was this, on the basis of God's word,

45
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,520
let's use to their full the talents that God has given us,

46
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,220
even though they are different from the talents that God has given to any other individual.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,320
And today in the concluding verses of the Romans, the twelfth chapter,

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,020
St. Paul speaks to us in the word of God and he calls on us and he tells us

49
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,000
that we who are Christians, we who have tasted of the mercies of God,

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,160
he says, be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
We may say, what's he talking about?

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,580
Well, the fact that we are not to be overcome by evil,

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,160
we know exactly what he means by this evil in its context.

54
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,120
And this evil we find is this that he has special reference to,

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,340
the evil of a spirit of revenge in our hearts.

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,640
Paul says, do not let a spirit of revenge conquer you.

57
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,080
Do not let a spirit within you that means to get even with everybody who has done you wrong.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,740
Do not let a spirit of revenge within you whereby you say,

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,380
I'm going to repay an evil deed with an evil deed.

60
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,400
Paul says, do not let that kind of an evil conquer you.

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,740
But he says, you conquer that evil, you conquer that spirit of revenge in doing good,

62
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,300
in repaying an evil deed with a good deed.

63
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,420
Mind you, Christian friends, this is the call of the word of God,

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,900
that you and I are to see to it that a spirit of revenge,

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,940
a spirit of sweet revenge shall be conquered in us

66
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,820
and that we shall do it in this way,

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,200
that we shall repay an evil deed, not with another evil deed,

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,040
that we shall repay an evil deed, not by doing nothing,

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,660
but by doing something,

70
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,540
and that is by doing a good turn.

71
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,700
We may say to ourselves this morning, that's ridiculous.

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,220
When you think about it, we say, yes, Christians,

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,120
you mean to say that I am to repay an evil turn,

74
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,200
a bad turn with a good one?

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,180
Do you mean to say that that is my obligation as a Christian?

76
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,760
We may say to ourselves, that's ridiculous, that is utterly silly.

77
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,920
We may conclude why it's silly because you've got everything to lose

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,340
and you haven't got a thing to gain.

79
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,300
We may say to ourselves, what good is it to repay an evil deed with a good deed,

80
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,300
that I am to go out of my way to conquer the desire within my heart

81
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,060
that I'm going to return a man tit for tat and that I'm going to do him a good deed

82
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,680
in exchange for something evil that he has done for me?

83
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,180
We may say, that doesn't pay.

84
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,560
We may also say, if that's Christianity, I don't want any of it.

85
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,720
We may say, if that's Christian psychology, that's for the birds.

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,320
That is not for me because somehow or other, isn't it strange,

87
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,280
when we are told that we are to overcome evil with good,

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,780
that we are to stifle a spirit of revenge

89
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,780
by a real deed of kindness to somebody who has harmed us,

90
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,820
we say, well, you're going to lose everything

91
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,400
and you can't gain a thing.

92
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,680
I wonder if on this 20th anniversary of radio broadcast

93
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,560
and as we turn to the word of God,

94
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,600
whether we can't just look at it for a moment and see,

95
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,660
whether this isn't Christianity at its best

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,680
as we apply it into our practical Christian life,

97
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,440
whether this isn't the very finest thing

98
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
that when God Almighty says to you and me,

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,420
overcome evil with good,

100
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,960
repay a bad turn with a good one,

101
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
do something and let it be something positive,

102
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,140
something fine and something good.

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,160
You and I have everything to gain

104
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,400
and really nothing to lose.

105
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,020
What is there to lose?

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
When in the first place, God would remind us of this,

107
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,540
that God repaid a very evil deed,

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,420
a very bad turn with a real good turn

109
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,120
in the Garden of Eden.

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Do you remember?

111
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,040
Let's go back to the creation of the world

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,460
and go back to the Garden of Eden

113
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,060
when the Lord God, when he had brought into existence

114
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,320
this universe by the power of his word

115
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,340
and God had decreed that this universe

116
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,900
was going to be created for a being

117
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,320
that he was going to call man,

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,500
that God was going to put on this earth

119
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,620
a creature called man,

120
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,600
that God might love that creature

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
and that that creature in turn might love him.

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,980
And so we read that the Lord God formed man

123
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,220
of the dust of the ground.

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,980
God formed our bodies

125
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,100
and what a marvelous form it was

126
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,580
and not after his image

127
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,360
because God doesn't have a body

128
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,940
but God breathed into man's nostrils,

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,880
now nose holes, the breath of life

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,720
and man became a living soul.

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,540
We are made in the image of God

132
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,400
because God is a spirit,

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,620
God is a soul

134
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,420
and God made you and me a soul

135
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,480
and God made us with free will

136
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,220
that we might choose to love him

137
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,540
or that we might choose not to love him.

138
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,280
And there was a greater creation

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,660
that God had also made

140
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,000
and they were the angels

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,280
and some of those angels with free will

142
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,620
had chosen not to serve God.

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,540
And our God then,

144
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
he created man that man might love him

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,740
and that man might live in righteousness

146
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,460
and holiness

147
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,180
and that God might love man.

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,180
And when the test came,

149
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
what happened in Eden?

150
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,500
You and I know that our parents,

151
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,740
when they were tempted of Satan,

152
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,660
they chose not to love God

153
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,320
with all their heart, soul and mind

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,860
and they chose therefore

155
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,600
to be gods themselves

156
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,340
and they disobeyed God.

157
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,380
It was a dirty deal

158
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,840
and a dirty trick

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,960
that man gave God

160
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,060
in exchange for God's good turn.

161
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,320
But what did God do?

162
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,080
Was there a spirit of revenge in God

163
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
that he gloated and he said,

164
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Oh, I'm glad you did it.

165
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,820
There is a spirit of sweet revenge in me.

166
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,080
I am tickled to death,

167
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,680
Adam and Eve,

168
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,620
that you sinned

169
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,940
because now I can pounce on you

170
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,460
and I can make your life

171
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
as miserable as I possibly can.

172
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,720
Did God gloat over it?

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,940
Did God return it tit for tat?

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,420
When you stand in Eden's garden

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,820
and the Lord God turned to them,

176
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,420
what was it?

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,620
He returned in exchange

178
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,820
for that evil turn.

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,360
God gave them a good turn

180
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,400
because when God spoke to Satan

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,040
and Adam and Eve,

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,640
the first gospel was proclaimed.

183
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,380
In Genesis the third chapter,

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,280
the 15th verse,

185
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,900
when God says,

186
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,040
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman,

187
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
between thy seed and her seed.

188
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,260
It shall bruise thy head

189
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,640
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
And the whole Bible

191
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
is an unfolding of that glorious verse

192
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,620
that when God says,

193
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,940
I'll give you another chance.

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,240
There was a good turn.

195
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,800
God said,

196
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,780
From you Eve will come

197
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,560
the seed of the woman,

198
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,220
the Savior and the Redeemer

199
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
who would come and suffer

200
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,680
and die for the sins of the world.

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,680
And in him you will have life

202
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,120
and everlasting salvation.

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,280
There was a glorious good turn

204
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,900
given by God in Eden

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,120
for an evil turn.

206
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,760
And therefore you say,

207
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,060
Well, we've got everything to lose

208
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,860
and nothing to gain.

209
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Oh, friend, that isn't true.

210
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,300
Here is Christianity at its best

211
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,100
because when you and I

212
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,120
are going to conquer

213
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
a spirit within us

214
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,820
whereby we have filled,

215
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,420
our hearts filled with revenge,

216
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,120
and we're going to again

217
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,020
exchange a man tit for tat,

218
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,000
and we're going to even the score

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,480
regardless of what it means,

220
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,780
when we realize that God

221
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,940
exchanged a real good turn

222
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,920
for an evil one,

223
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,340
then and only then

224
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,300
can we have the joy

225
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,440
when we do likewise

226
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
that the faith within you and me

227
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,240
is a living faith.

228
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,180
It's not a debtor

229
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,360
than a doornail faith.

230
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,900
Many a man can get up

231
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,120
and assent to the creed.

232
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,360
Many a man can say

233
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,280
that he believes in God

234
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,800
as Father

235
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
and in Jesus Christ

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,120
and he believes in the Holy Spirit.

237
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,760
But you know and I know

238
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,820
that unless that faith

239
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,240
shows itself in your life

240
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,720
and mine,

241
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,980
unless you and I

242
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,780
can look and say,

243
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,580
Here is a faith

244
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,360
that is active,

245
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,520
unless,

246
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,060
let's put it right down

247
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,860
to brass stacks

248
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,660
unless you can look

249
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,180
in your life

250
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
and I can look at mine,

251
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,800
that there is a conquering

252
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,940
within our own hearts

253
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,160
of a spirit of revenge

254
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,100
whereby we repay

255
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,020
an evil deed

256
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,860
with a good one,

257
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,500
whereby we go out

258
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,360
of our way

259
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,660
to do a kindness

260
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
to somebody

261
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,480
who has injured us.

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,580
You and I

263
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,520
have no evidence

264
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,680
that our faith is living,

265
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,060
that we have been

266
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,520
blood-bought in Jesus Christ

267
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,380
and that we have been

268
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,760
saved unto eternal life.

269
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,300
Show me a Christian

270
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,680
who is willing again

271
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
to repay an evil deed

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,300
with a good one

273
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,560
and I'll show you one

274
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,500
who can say my faith

275
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,940
is living

276
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,880
and I know I have been

277
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,580
saved from hell

278
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,260
and damnation

279
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,420
and I know that

280
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,680
in the blood of Jesus Christ

281
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,620
shed on Calvary,

282
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,380
life and eternal salvation

283
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,900
have become,

284
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,200
I know,

285
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,040
and I ask you this moment,

286
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,920
what do you lose?

287
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,740
Listen,

288
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,760
this is Christianity

289
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,320
in its finest hour

290
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,820
in its practical application.

291
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,280
This is Christianity

292
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,380
in its very finest dress.

293
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,260
God Almighty assures

294
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,080
you and me,

295
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
says we are to overcome evil,

296
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
a spirit of revenge

297
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,700
and to overcome it

298
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,020
by doing good.

299
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,600
We must repay

300
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,220
an evil turn

301
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,560
with a good turn.

302
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,600
That's Christianity

303
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,260
and you have everything

304
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,880
to gain

305
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
and nothing to lose

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,400
and that's why

307
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,320
this is the 20th anniversary

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,260
of the broadcasting

309
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,360
of the word of God

310
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
and on this day

311
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,740
we ought to say to ourselves

312
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,180
if that's what God wants,

313
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,280
that's what God

314
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
shall get from my life

315
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,540
and when we have determined

316
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,480
that we are going to

317
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,220
conquer evil

318
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,040
in our lives,

319
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,340
a spirit of revenge

320
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,060
by in every case

321
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,760
when somebody

322
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,980
does us a dirty trick

323
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,500
that we shall respond

324
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,720
with a good deed,

325
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,500
then and only then

326
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,280
can you and I

327
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
ever avoid

328
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800
having the spirit

329
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,400
of revenge

330
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,320
conquer us.

331
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,740
Old Paul says,

332
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,960
don't let a spirit

333
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,540
of revenge

334
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,160
conquer you.

335
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,740
I wonder how many of us

336
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,220
in church

337
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,080
or on the radio

338
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,380
have really allowed

339
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,500
a spirit of revenge

340
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,400
to conquer us.

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,200
How many of us

342
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
are dominated

343
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,560
by a spirit

344
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,300
of revenge?

345
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
I'll get even

346
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,900
if it's the last thing

347
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,680
I ever do

348
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,900
and we gloat over it

349
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
and I'll get even

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,980
with a dirty deal

351
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,540
that somebody

352
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,200
has given me

353
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,420
and as long as

354
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,060
there's breath

355
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,960
in my body

356
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,180
I'll pay him back

357
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,460
coin for coin

358
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,780
and I'll give him

359
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,680
the same deal

360
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,460
that he has given me.

361
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
How many of us

362
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,880
are complete slaves

363
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,340
of again

364
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,780
a desire for revenge?

365
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,200
It's tragic.

366
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
Look at the life

367
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,780
of Moses

368
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,740
what he paid.

369
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,020
Moses had a hot temper

370
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,000
and remember

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,660
when he was out

372
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,120
one day

373
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,540
and he saw

374
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,020
an Egyptian

375
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,820
whipping a Hebrew

376
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,400
and Moses again

377
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,260
allowed his temper

378
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,760
to flare

379
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,160
and there was

380
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,020
a spirit of revenge

381
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,580
and he killed

382
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,840
a man right on the spot

383
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,420
and threw him

384
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,860
in the gutter

385
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,720
and he covered him up.

386
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,280
He thought nobody

387
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,940
saw it

388
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,640
but the next day

389
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,380
when two Hebrews

390
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,080
were arguing

391
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,860
and Moses tried

392
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,480
to quiet them

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,040
the one Hebrew

394
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,540
said you're going

395
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,100
to kill me

396
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,840
or you're going

397
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,240
to kill us

398
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,820
like you killed

399
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,400
that Egyptian

400
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,980
yesterday.

401
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,420
Moses had to flee

402
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,080
for his life

403
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,700
and don't forget

404
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,960
he spent 40 years

405
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,160
out in the Midian desert.

406
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:18,900
Why?

407
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,520
Because there was

408
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,840
a spirit of revenge.

409
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh you read

410
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,520
in the papers

411
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:22,920
you wonder

412
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,780
how in the world

413
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,580
can a father

414
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,120
and a mother

415
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,180
how can they

416
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,040
take a little infant

417
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,800
child and just

418
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,720
beat its literal

419
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,780
brains out?

420
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,800
How can they

421
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,680
take a little child

422
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,940
because it cries

423
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,180
in a spirit

424
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,120
of revenge

425
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,820
whip it

426
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,700
so it's black

427
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,140
and blue

428
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,740
and fracture

429
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,300
it's scald

430
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,660
and you read

431
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,340
it every week.

432
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,720
Why?

433
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,540
Because there are

434
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,260
people whose

435
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,360
spirit of revenge

436
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,680
controls them

437
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,240
who are slaves

438
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,800
and how many

439
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,300
husbands

440
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,040
because a wife

441
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,600
leaves them

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,480
for good reason

443
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,120
or for not

444
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,680
good reason

445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,340
will turn around

446
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,480
and kill the children

447
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
kill the wife

448
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,480
and the father-in-law

449
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,220
and the mother-in-law

450
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,220
go out with no end

451
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,120
because revenge

452
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,700
seems sweet.

453
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,720
Her wives

454
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,980
doing the same thing.

455
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,720
What a price

456
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,780
and what a tragedy

457
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,740
and yet men say

458
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,120
revenge is sweet

459
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,620
revenge is costly

460
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,640
and it is tragic.

461
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,240
Let's get also

462
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,620
down in every congregation

463
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,460
oh this happens

464
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,380
to every minister

465
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,800
many a time

466
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm called

467
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
to see somebody

468
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,080
and I'm told

469
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,640
that the person

470
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,380
is a Lutheran

471
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,600
and I say

472
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,460
I don't know you

473
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,520
where did you belong?

474
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,720
Then you get a story

475
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,020
something

476
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,780
I belonged

477
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,520
about 40 years ago

478
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,760
to a Lutheran church

479
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,980
but the minister

480
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,860
said something

481
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,040
that hurt my feelings

482
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,820
or somebody

483
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,660
did something

484
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,860
real or imaginary

485
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,080
and so I withdrew

486
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,720
then you see

487
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,160
a person

488
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,380
lying on a sick bed

489
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
and on a death bed

490
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,320
been filled

491
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,380
and conquered

492
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,040
with a spirit

493
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,100
of revenge

494
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,320
living their lives

495
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,080
in revenge

496
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,740
and in resentment

497
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,080
shriveled souls

498
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,740
that have done

499
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,640
nothing miserable

500
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,040
then there's also

501
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,680
the member

502
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,600
that because

503
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,240
of a spirit

504
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,860
of revenge

505
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,360
if he thinks

506
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,860
he isn't getting

507
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,620
a just deal

508
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,180
he stays away

509
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,860
from church

510
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,520
and he hopes

511
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,080
that everybody

512
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
notices it

513
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
because that goes

514
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,020
with this gloating

515
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,860
of revenge

516
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,300
and God pity

517
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,100
if you don't

518
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,900
notice it

519
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,320
then he gets angry

520
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,420
because you don't

521
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,560
notice his spirit

522
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,200
of revenge

523
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,620
how silly

524
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,760
can you and I

525
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,360
get with a

526
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,300
shriveled up soul

527
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,040
oh the shriveled

528
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
souls we find

529
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,660
in the name of

530
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,020
Jesus

531
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,960
because men

532
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,520
have allowed

533
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,420
a spirit

534
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,240
of revenge

535
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,800
I'll get even

536
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
to conquer

537
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,580
their lives

538
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,120
and the tragedy

539
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,020
of it all is

540
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,440
you lose

541
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
your eternal life

542
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
shriveled souls

543
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
lying on sick beds

544
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,080
ready for death

545
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,940
whose lives

546
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,480
have counted

547
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,180
for nothing

548
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,480
because revenge

549
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,020
seems so sweet

550
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,400
it's the most

551
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
damnable bitter

552
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,600
taste

553
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
that could ever

554
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,420
come to your

555
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,340
soul and mine

556
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,800
this is Christianity

557
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,840
at its best

558
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
strange what

559
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,820
creatures we are

560
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,160
that we say

561
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,100
revenge is so

562
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,880
sweet that if

563
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,760
this is Christianity

564
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,820
that I must

565
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,440
return an evil

566
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
turn with a good

567
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,960
one that it's

568
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,800
not for me

569
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
that I've got

570
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,620
everything to lose

571
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,560
and nothing to gain

572
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,380
oh it isn't so

573
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,200
it's Christianity

574
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,620
at its best

575
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,560
in its finest

576
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,960
hour

577
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,420
why

578
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,960
God Almighty

579
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,560
says you've

580
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,160
tasted of the

581
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,100
mercies of God

582
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,140
and God says

583
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,900
overcome evil

584
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,520
with good

585
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
mind you

586
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,000
I am to overcome

587
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,040
that spirit

588
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,020
of resentment

589
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,040
that spirit

590
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,760
within me

591
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,160
of a vengeance

592
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,140
and the spirit

593
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,020
of revenge

594
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,260
not by

595
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,520
repaying an evil

596
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,020
deed with

597
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,720
another evil

598
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,100
deed

599
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,280
or not even

600
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,880
by saying

601
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,580
well I'll just

602
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,200
do nothing

603
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
that isn't it

604
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,820
God says

605
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
by doing

606
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,640
something

607
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
by doing

608
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,160
something that

609
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,920
is good

610
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,180
you just

611
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,020
don't sit

612
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,660
like a bump

613
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,500
on a log

614
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,580
you do

615
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,020
something

616
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,480
and you do

617
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,840
something

618
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,320
kind

619
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,100
it's

620
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,660
Christianity

621
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,460
at its best

622
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,760
you have

623
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,540
nothing to lose

624
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,840
and everything

625
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,240
to gain

626
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,620
why

627
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,740
because in the

628
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,280
second place

629
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,020
God reminds

630
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,420
you and me

631
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,020
that he will

632
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,520
repay every

633
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,820
evil turn

634
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,120
that any man

635
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,920
has ever done

636
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,740
against you

637
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,260
and me

638
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,940
you know

639
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,500
sometimes we

640
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,960
may get the

641
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,540
wrong idea

642
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,060
when Paul

643
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,660
says

644
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,860
dearly beloved

645
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,240
he says

646
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,900
avenge not

647
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,340
yourselves

648
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,840
but rather

649
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,420
give place

650
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,720
to wrath

651
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,020
he says

652
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,660
let God

653
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,260
take care

654
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,600
of this

655
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,880
thing

656
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
because God

657
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,340
says

658
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,720
and Paul

659
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,220
quotes the

660
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,760
Old Testament

661
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,200
he says

662
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,100
God says

663
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,900
vengeance is

664
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,280
mine

665
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,060
that belongs

666
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,520
to me

667
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,240
that's in

668
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,000
my field

669
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,680
that's my

670
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,340
prerogative

671
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,520
I will

672
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:35,960
repay

673
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,560
I'll take

674
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:36,920
care of

675
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,160
this

676
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,740
you know

677
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,400
sometimes we

678
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,740
may get

679
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,220
the idea

680
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,700
well I'm

681
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,060
not going

682
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,340
to take

683
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,680
revenge

684
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm going

685
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,220
to let

686
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,760
God do

687
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,940
it

688
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,620
and then we

689
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,400
picture God

690
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,500
as a revengeful

691
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,220
God who has

692
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,840
a taste for

693
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,200
blood

694
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,060
who gloats

695
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,120
will you

696
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,540
bear this

697
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,980
in mind

698
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,560
that God

699
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,260
said this

700
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,600
as I live

701
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,160
saith the

702
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,480
Lord

703
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,180
God swears

704
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,100
by himself

705
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,900
because there

706
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,520
is no one

707
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,120
greater by

708
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,500
whom he

709
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,220
could swear

710
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,320
but God

711
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,180
takes an oath

712
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,640
and God

713
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,020
says

714
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,280
as I live

715
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,180
I swear

716
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,980
by my

717
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,700
existence

718
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,100
that I

719
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,780
have no

720
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,280
pleasure

721
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,600
in the

722
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,000
death of

723
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,380
the wicked

724
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,960
don't let

725
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,500
any man

726
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,000
ever tell

727
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,500
you that

728
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,020
God has

729
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,500
a spirit

730
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,040
of revenge

731
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,200
that God

732
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,760
gloats

733
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,220
in seeing

734
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,620
the soul

735
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,080
lost

736
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,020
don't let

737
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,700
any man

738
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,240
ever tell

739
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,740
you I'm

740
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,000
going to

741
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,500
let God

742
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,980
take care

743
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,280
of this

744
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,060
and boy

745
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,500
oh boy

746
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,040
when God

747
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,520
gets through

748
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,040
with somebody

749
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,380
in his

750
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,800
spirit of

751
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,100
revenge

752
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,540
he can do

753
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,820
a lot

754
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,100
worse

755
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,380
things

756
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,820
than I

757
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,760
that

758
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,240
isn't

759
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,660
true

760
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,900
God's

761
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,260
vengeance

762
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,800
is his

763
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,380
justice

764
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,880
and God's

765
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,420
justice

766
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,900
yes

767
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,280
it's an

768
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,740
eye for

769
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,180
an eye

770
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,540
and it's

771
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:34,860
a tooth

772
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,480
for a tooth

773
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,380
but it's

774
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,980
a justice

775
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,520
that is

776
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,040
administered

777
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,800
in sadness

778
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
it is a

779
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,420
justice

780
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:40,940
that would

781
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,360
rather

782
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,880
administer

783
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,500
grace

784
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,440
God

785
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,880
says

786
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,440
I'll

787
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,800
take

788
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
care

789
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,680
of the

790
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,460
wrongs

791
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,100
that men

792
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,660
have done

793
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,040
you let

794
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,460
me do

795
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,880
that

796
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,380
and God

797
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,800
says

798
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,400
that's my

799
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
prerogative

800
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,660
though the

801
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,220
mills of

802
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,080
God grind

803
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,600
slowly

804
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,380
they grind

805
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,060
exceedingly

806
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,600
fine

807
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,580
and God

808
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,160
reminds you

809
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,360
and me

810
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,620
that he

811
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,960
doesn't

812
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,260
balance

813
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,540
books

814
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,000
every day

815
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,300
you know

816
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,720
you and I

817
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:01,960
would like

818
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,360
to balance

819
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,680
them every

820
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:02,840
day

821
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,440
right now

822
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
if somebody

823
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:04,900
again

824
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,600
comes back

825
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,980
at us

826
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,520
with an

827
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:06,980
evil deed

828
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,380
we're ready

829
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,920
to repay

830
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,300
with the

831
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,580
same

832
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,080
thing

833
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,300
God

834
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,840
says

835
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,340
overcome

836
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,860
evil

837
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,620
with good

838
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,100
what's the

839
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,440
joy

840
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,060
what is there

841
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,480
to gain

842
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:15,820
listen

843
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,540
a God

844
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,980
who is

845
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,680
big enough

846
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,780
who promises

847
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,480
you and me

848
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,020
that he will

849
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,980
repay every

850
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,620
evil deed

851
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,220
that any man

852
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,720
has done

853
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,400
against us

854
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,300
and do it

855
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,100
in judgment

856
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,560
not in gloating

857
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,240
not in a

858
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,200
spiritual revenge

859
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,360
is a God

860
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,100
that gives us

861
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,720
this joy

862
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,500
that he is able

863
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,160
to keep this

864
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,560
promise

865
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,140
that he will

866
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,820
overrule

867
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,380
every evil

868
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,880
turn

869
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,360
in your

870
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,760
life

871
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,220
and mine

872
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,600
and make

873
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:37,960
it a good

874
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,220
one

875
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,740
you realize

876
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,400
that God

877
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,860
says

878
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,580
a reversal

879
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,200
will take

880
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,480
place

881
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,760
in your

882
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,120
life

883
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,440
if you

884
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,580
will

885
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,880
trust

886
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,280
me

887
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,560
in other

888
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,840
words

889
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,380
let's put

890
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:46,540
it

891
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,180
just like

892
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,380
this

893
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,780
when any

894
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,160
man

895
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,600
does you

896
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:48,860
and me

897
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,200
an evil

898
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,480
turn

899
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,000
he's actually

900
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,440
doing us

901
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,940
a favor

902
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,240
he is

903
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,640
actually

904
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,120
doing us

905
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,300
a favor

906
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,900
we express

907
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,300
it some

908
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,640
ways

909
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,140
like this

910
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,520
we say

911
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,960
a knocks

912
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,440
a boost

913
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,860
it is

914
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,120
as a

915
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,460
Christian

916
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,880
why

917
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,740
God

918
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,300
promises

919
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,880
that every

920
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,180
evil

921
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,580
action

922
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,900
of any

923
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,160
man

924
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,700
against you

925
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,080
and me

926
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,920
every

927
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,260
evil

928
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,060
word

929
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,300
any

930
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,680
kind

931
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:04,820
of

932
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,300
retribution

933
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,640
God

934
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:05,880
says

935
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,220
I will

936
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,660
overrule

937
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:06,800
it

938
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,100
for your

939
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,480
good

940
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
you and

941
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,640
I can

942
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:08,800
say

943
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,180
how can

944
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,320
you

945
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,800
overrule

946
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,140
an evil

947
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,360
turn

948
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,700
make it

949
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:10,920
a good

950
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,080
one

951
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,460
well I'll

952
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:11,680
give you

953
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,080
the greatest

954
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,540
reversal

955
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:12,960
that ever

956
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,420
took place

957
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,740
in human

958
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,160
history

959
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,300
stand at

960
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,740
Calvary

961
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,100
for the

962
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,320
moment

963
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,580
if you

964
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:16,840
want to

965
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,120
see a

966
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,460
reversal

967
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,380
if there

968
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,740
was ever

969
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,120
a dirty

970
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,460
deal

971
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,760
if there

972
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,100
was ever

973
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,520
a dirty

974
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,100
indignity

975
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,420
if there

976
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,760
was ever

977
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,200
a mean

978
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,640
turn

979
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,340
it was

980
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,740
the fact

981
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,140
that men

982
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,440
murdered

983
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,800
the son

984
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,280
of God

985
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,800
on no

986
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,240
basis

987
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,380
was there

988
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,620
any

989
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,300
justification

990
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,980
for

991
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,780
crucifying

992
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,220
Jesus

993
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,800
Christ

994
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,480
they

995
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,940
couldn't

996
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,360
find

997
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,780
anything

998
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,360
they put

999
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,640
him to

1000
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,820
death

1001
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,180
because

1002
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,700
they hated

1003
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:34,860
him

1004
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,140
without

1005
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,740
cause

1006
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,540
he was

1007
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,720
the

1008
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,060
innocent

1009
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,460
man

1010
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,780
as the

1011
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,020
world

1012
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,440
still

1013
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,920
says

1014
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,400
that it

1015
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,640
was the

1016
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:39,880
greatest

1017
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,260
life

1018
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,520
that was

1019
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,740
ever

1020
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,020
lived

1021
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,260
it was

1022
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,640
the most

1023
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,900
holy

1024
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,300
life

1025
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,160
and therefore

1026
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,600
if there

1027
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,860
ever

1028
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,280
was an

1029
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,520
evil

1030
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:44,860
turn

1031
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,140
that

1032
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,420
was

1033
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,760
it

1034
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,700
and yet

1035
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,380
God

1036
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,300
reversed

1037
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,080
that evil

1038
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,500
turn

1039
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,040
and made

1040
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,500
it a good

1041
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,740
one

1042
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,080
why

1043
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,560
because

1044
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,960
you and

1045
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,260
I

1046
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,820

1047
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,040

00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,520
Calvary

1049
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,440
and we

1050
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,760
say

1051
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,320
it was

1052
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,500
an

turn

1055
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,400
but

1056
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,760
God

1057
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,020
has

1058
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,460
reversed

1059
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,720
it

1060
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,160
because

1061
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,780
there's

1062
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,900

there

1067
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,000

1068
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,160

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,680
bought

1073
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,080

1074
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,600
saved

think

1109
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,380
that someone

1110
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,160
who has

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,820
has done

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,100
look to

Calvary

1122
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,540
there was

1123
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,020

1128
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,060

1136
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,220
it's

1158
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,380
you can

1159
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,700
see it

1160
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:35,940
in his

1161
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,240
life

1162
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,580
he had

1163
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:36,820
ten

1164
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,140
brothers

1165
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,440
that put

1166
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,820
him down

1167
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,100
in a

hole

1170
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,560
it was

1171
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,080
waterless

1172
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,280
and they

1173
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,480
were going

1174
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,720
to allow

1175
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:40,960
him to

1176
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,280
starve

1177
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,780
to death

1178
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,040

to death

1181
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,400
then they

1182
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,120
decided to

1183
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,480
sell him

1184
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,100
into slavery

1185
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,640
which they

1186
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,440
did in spite

1187
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,760

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,220
pleas

1189
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,140

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,500
Egypt

1191
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,000

Potiphar

1195
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,240
bought him

as a

1197
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:50,760
slave

1198
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,100
put him

1199
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,340
in his

1200
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,740
home

1201
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,800
Potiphar's

1202
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,320
wife fell

1203
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,600
in love

1204
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,000
with him

1205
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,580
rather than

1206
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,980
sin with

1207
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,220
her

1208
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,640
what

1209
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,280
happened

1210
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,660
Joseph

1211
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,160
ended up

1212
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,660
in jail

1213
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,580
there he

1214
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,080
was in jail

1215
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,580
for several

1216
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,800
years

1217
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,480
until finally

1218
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,120
some dreams

1219
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,600
came to

1220
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Pharaoh

1221
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,860
and one

1222
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,060
of the

1223
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,420
men who

1224
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,680
had been

1225
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,120
in jail

1226
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,460
with

1227
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,920
Joseph

1228
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,380
remembered

1229
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,680
that he

1230
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:05,840
could

1231
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,220
interpret

1232
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,780
dreams

1233
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,780
and God

1234
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,080
what

1235
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,620
reversed

1236
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:08,920
the

1237
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,660
indignities

1238
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,000
in the

1239
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,280
life

1240
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,460
of

1241
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:10,840
Joseph

1242
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,760
so that

1243
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,380
by means

1244
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,580
of

1245
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,900
Joseph

1246
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,140
who

1247
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,540
became

1248
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,740
the

1249
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,040
prime

1250
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,360
minister

1251
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,640
in

1252
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:14,920
Egypt

1253
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,540
many

1254
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,020
souls

1255
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,280
were

1256
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,720
saved

1257
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:16,860
in

1258
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,000
the

1259
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,320
famine

1260
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,540
that

1261
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:17,700
hit

1262
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:17,880
the

1263
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,300
land

1264
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
reversal

1265
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,760
oh your

1266
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,220
life and

1267
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,460
mine

1268
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,840
may not

1269
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,140
be as

1270
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,540
dramatic

1271
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,020
as that

1272
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,180
as

1273
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,500
Joseph

1274
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,340
but we

1275
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,860
can know

1276
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,160
this

1277
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,800
that here

1278
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,320
is

1279
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,020
Christianity

1280
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,620
at its

1281
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,080
best

1282
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,640
there

1283
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:27,960
isn't

1284
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,300
anything

1285
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,000
to lose

1286
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,200
there

1287
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,380
is

1288
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,740
everything

1289
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,400
to gain

1290
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,060
when you

1291
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,440
and I

1292
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,160
conquer a

1293
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,580
spirit

1294
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,720
of revenge

1295
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
in doing

1296
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,820
good

1297
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,800
in repaying

1298
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,260
an evil

1299
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,980
turn with

1300
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,420
a good

1301
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,860
one

1302
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,840
God

1303
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,160
says

1304
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,500
I'll

1305
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,000
overrule

1306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,340
every

1307
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,080
indignity

1308
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,060
for your

1309
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,480
eternal

1310
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,080
welfare

1311
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,760
and let's

1312
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,420
let God

1313
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,960
do it

1314
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,720
God's

1315
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,140
big enough

1316
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,680
to do it

1317
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:47,980
and on

1318
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,620
this 20th

1319
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,080
anniversary

1320
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,800
when we

1321
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,360
talk about

1322
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,680
what do

1323
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:51,980
you do

1324
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,340
on an

1325
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,800
anniversary

1326
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,860
well again

1327
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,120
you do

1328
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,480
the same

1329
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,780
thing you

1330
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,120
have done

1331
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,460
throughout

1332
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,080
20 years

1333
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,500
you turn

1334
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:56,780
to the

1335
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,080
word of

1336
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,420
God

1337
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,140
and the

1338
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,440
word of

1339
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,680
God

1340
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,160
speaks to

1341
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,440
you and

1342
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,640
me

1343
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,140
and says

1344
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,560
we are

1345
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,140
to overcome

1346
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,500
evil

1347
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,080
with good

1348
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,820
there ought

1349
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,140
to be a

1350
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,600
determination

1351
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,300
then that we

1352
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,740
say this

1353
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,140
that as a

1354
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,520
Christian

1355
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,440
this is

1356
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,880
Christianity

1357
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
at its best

1358
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,260
since you've

1359
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,240
got everything

1360
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,920
to gain

1361
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,520
nothing to

1362
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,800
lose

1363
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,260
since it

1364
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,780
actually

1365
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,420
pays

1366
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,140
there ought

1367
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,520
to be a

1368
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,980
determination

1369
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,520
that in

1370
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,940
your life

1371
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,300
and mine

1372
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,820
this shall

1373
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,280
be the way

1374
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,680
of life

1375
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,000
as a

1376
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,360
Christian

1377
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,500
we are

1378
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,060
going to

1379
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,460
see that

1380
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,500
we repay

1381
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:20,980
an evil

1382
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,300
turn

1383
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,740
not with

1384
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,300
another evil

1385
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,720
turn

1386
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,580
that we

1387
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,260
repay an

1388
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,460
evil

1389
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,960
turn not

1390
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,560
by doing

1391
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:25,920
nothing

1392
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,520
but by

1393
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,000
doing

1394
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,560
something

1395
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,020
and that

1396
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,500
something

1397
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,220
positive

1398
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,120
a good

1399
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,460
deed

1400
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,800
and when

1401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,120
we do

1402
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,440
that

1403
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,040
then we

1404
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,400
are going

1405
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,720
to begin

1406
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,180
to realize

1407
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,520
that it

1408
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:33,960
does make

1409
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,300
a difference

1410
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,820
what people

1411
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,240
think

1412
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,360
it's strange

1413
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
again Paul

1414
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,780
says this

1415
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,600
that we are

1416
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,100
to prove

1417
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,700
all things

1418
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,160
and we are

1419
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,620
to show

1420
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,260
ourselves

1421
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,800
good in

1422
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,320
the sight

1423
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,080
of men

1424
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,180
sometimes

1425
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,720
we as

1426
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:44,880
Christians

1427
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,080
say I

1428
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,380
don't care

1429
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,820
what people

1430
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,220
say

1431
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,240
isn't it

1432
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,720
strange how

1433
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,160
many of us

1434
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,460
with a

1435
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:48,940
spirit of

1436
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,300
revenge

1437
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,700
we're going

1438
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:49,900
to get

1439
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,140
even

1440
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,540
we still

1441
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:50,960
claim we're

1442
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,380
Christians

1443
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,180
and we're

1444
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,380
going to

1445
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,600
come to

1446
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,060
it doesn't

1447
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,420
make any

1448
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,660
difference

1449
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,020
but listen

1450
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,380
friend it

1451
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:56,720
makes a

1452
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,160
tremendous

1453
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,620
difference

1454
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,140
what people

1455
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,560
think

1456
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,340
because again

1457
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,180
if people

1458
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,840
can look at

1459
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,300
you and me

1460
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,940
as a Christian

1461
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,500
and say

1462
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,320
here is a

1463
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,800
spirit of

1464
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,200
revenge

1465
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,700
here is a

1466
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,080
gloating

1467
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,740
here is one

1468
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,300
who is

1469
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,280
filled again

1470
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,900
with sweet

1471
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,420
revenge

1472
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,800
who is

1473
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,280
conquered

1474
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,920
by that

1475
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,360
kind of

1476
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,820
an evil

1477
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,020
what do

1478
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,340
you think

1479
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,780
you and I

1480
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,100
can do

1481
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,640
in the cause

1482
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,120
of peace

1483
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,760
in the world

1484
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,860
Paul puts

1485
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,380
it this way

1486
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,700
he said

1487
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,400
if it be

1488
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,900
possible

1489
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,640
as much

1490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,360
as lieth

1491
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,140
within you

1492
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,460
live peaceably

1493
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,000
with all

1494
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,240
men

1495
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,740
oh we're

1496
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,360
praying for

1497
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,740
peace

1498
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,460
and we

1499
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,120
want peace

1500
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,600
but what

1501
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,160
must you

1502
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,520
and I

1503
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,020
do before

1504
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,380
we have

1505
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,800
a right

1506
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,260
to pray

1507
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,940
for peace

1508
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,340
Paul says

1509
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,860
if it be

1510
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,320
possible

1511
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,060
as much

1512
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,440
as it

1513
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,000
depends

1514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,800
on you

1515
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,080
the big

1516
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,600
thing is

1517
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:36,920
there's

1518
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,240
something

1519
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,700
in this

1520
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:37,880
thing

1521
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,240
of peace

1522
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,860
that depends

1523
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,460
on you

1524
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,740
and it

1525
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,220
depends

1526
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,720
on me

1527
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,260
what can

1528
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,900
I do

1529
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,860
if it

1530
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,400
depends

1531
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,920
on me

1532
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,360
the thing

1533
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,760
that I

1534
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,400
can do

1535
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,880
and that I

1536
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,420
must do

1537
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:46,880
regardless

1538
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,220
of what

1539
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,540
the other

1540
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,080
fellow does

1541
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,540
is this

1542
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,340
that I

1543
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,100
must conquer

1544
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,780
a spirit

1545
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,620
of revenge

1546
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,100
by returning

1547
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,900
good

1548
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,280
instead of evil

1549
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,100
that has been

1550
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,540
done

1551
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,700
you and I

1552
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,640
have no right

1553
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,960
to pray for peace

1554
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,480
unless we are

1555
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,180
willing to tell

1556
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,580
God

1557
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,940
I on my part

1558
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,120
I'm doing my

1559
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
part for peace

1560
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,280
because I am

1561
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,420
conquering a

1562
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,660
desire in my

1563
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,140
heart for

1564
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,620
revenge

1565
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,800
and I

1566
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,500
repay

1567
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,740
an indignity

1568
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,200
with a good

1569
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,880
deed

1570
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,980
with a kind

1571
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,460
deed

1572
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,580
praying for

1573
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,000
peace

1574
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,400
aren't we

1575
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,320
oh when I

1576
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,000
was in Geneva

1577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,860
and we stopped

1578
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,440
at a place

1579
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,900
and there was

1580
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,460
a legend

1581
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,660
Woodrow Wilson

1582
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,400
the founder

1583
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,820
of the League

1584
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,300
of Nations

1585
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,040
where is the

1586
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,820
League of Nations

1587
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,640
it's gone

1588
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,180
isn't it

1589
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,140
the United

1590
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,260
League Nations

1591
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,180
was in session

1592
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,860
at the time

1593
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,840
talking about

1594
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,480
the Laos

1595
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,240
controversy

1596
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,980
and I heard

1597
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,340
Adlai Stevenson

1598
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:39,780
give his

1599
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,760
matchless address

1600
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,400
before the

1601
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,080
United Nations

1602
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,760
in New York

1603
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,700
when our

1604
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,440
president had

1605
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,120
declared what

1606
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,800
we had to do

1607
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,360
in the case

1608
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:46,900
of Cuba

1609
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,880
and what

1610
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,460
was the

1611
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,900
address

1612
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,580
to stand

1613
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,980
up there

1614
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,260
and to

1615
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,760
honestly

1616
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,320
have to

1617
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,540
say

1618
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,060
this is

1619
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,580
the reason

1620
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,160
why we

1621
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,620
have had

1622
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,100
to do

1623
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,980
what we

1624
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,420
are doing

1625
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:55,980
not in

1626
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,600
a spirit

1627
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,780
of vindictiveness

1628
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,060
but because

1629
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,980
the Soviet

1630
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,340
Union

1631
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,120
has lied

1632
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,780
to us

1633
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,700
the Soviet

1634
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,020
Union

1635
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,560
has told

1636
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:03,740
us

1637
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,020
that there

1638
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,340
are no

1639
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,920
missile bases

1640
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,300
and we

1641
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,480
know

1642
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:05,800
that there

1643
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,020
are

1644
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,220
here

1645
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,360
are

1646
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,520
the

1647
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:06,840
pictures

1648
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,860
we

1649
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,140
had to

1650
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,260
stand

1651
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,600
what's

1652
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,960
wrong

1653
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,320
listen

1654
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,340
the greatest

1655
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,940
peace

1656
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,460
plan

1657
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,880
that has

1658
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,160
ever

1659
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,680
come to

1660
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:12,920
this

1661
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,260
earth

1662
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,340
is this

1663
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,800
peace

1664
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,020
of

1665
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,680
practical

1666
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,580
Christianity

1667
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,560
overcome

1668
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,520
evil

1669
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,060
with good

1670
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,760
and therefore

1671
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,520
again there

1672
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,500
can be no

1673
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,080
peace in

1674
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,740
this world

1675
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,820
until it

1676
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,440
starts in

1677
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,960
your heart

1678
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,440
and mind

1679
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,820
and it

1680
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,380
starts

1681
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,140
where as

1682
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,780
far as

1683
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,260
we are

1684
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,800
concerned

1685
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,920
this shall

1686
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,240
be the

1687
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,540
rule of

1688
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:32,720
our

1689
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,080
Christian

1690
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,680
experience

1691
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,820
that we

1692
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,260
are going

1693
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,860
to overcome

1694
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,420
evil

1695
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,820
a desire

1696
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,300
in our

1697
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,520
heart

1698
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,840
to get

1699
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,280
even

1700
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,840
tit

1701
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
for tat

1702
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,620
to give

1703
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,040
a man

1704
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,540
his own

1705
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:42,980
coin

1706
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,440
back for

1707
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,660
what he

1708
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:43,980
has given

1709
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,360
us

1710
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,580
and instead

1711
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,380
of repaying

1712
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,960
him with

1713
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,700
an evil

1714
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,080
turn

1715
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,660
to repay

1716
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,000
him

1717
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,940
with a

1718
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,240
good

1719
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,820
turn

1720
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,940
that

1721
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,700
is the

1722
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,160
answer

1723
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,820
to the

1724
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,120
peace

1725
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,720
problem

1726
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,840
and until

1727
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,340
the world

1728
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,020
knows it

1729
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,400
it shall

1730
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
be embroiled

1731
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
in wars

1732
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and there

1733
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,360
will be

1734
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,840
rumors

1735
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,600
of wars

1736
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,760
20th

1737
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,620
anniversary

1738
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,400
of radio

1739
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,440
and we

1740
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,880
say what

1741
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,380
does God

1742
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,940
say today

1743
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,520
God says

1744
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,260
conquer evil

1745
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,940
with good

1746
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,400
God says

1747
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,060
conquer

1748
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,580
this desire

1749
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,500
of revenge

1750
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,720
and conquer

1751
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,260
it by

1752
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,060
doing good

1753
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,180
by repaying

1754
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,620
an evil

1755
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,180
turn with

1756
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,580
a good

1757
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:18,880
turn

1758
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,340
by doing

1759
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,760
something

1760
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,420
and we

1761
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:20,780
can say

1762
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,280
well that's

1763
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,760
ridiculous

1764
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,400
that's

1765
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,780
silly

1766
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,980
that won't

1767
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,540
work

1768
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,500
friends

1769
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,520
if Christianity

1770
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,480
is ever at

1771
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,080
its finest

1772
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,520
in its

1773
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,960
practical

1774
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,600
application

1775
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,100
it's right

1776
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,460
here

1777
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,440
because

1778
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,280
God Almighty

1779
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,240
also reminds

1780
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,600
you and

1781
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:33,920
me

1782
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,880
that when

1783
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,680
we repay

1784
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,180
an evil

1785
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,680
turn

1786
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,120
with a

1787
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,400
good

1788
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,980
turn

1789
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,100
somehow

1790
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,600
or other

1791
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
if anything

1792
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,160
does

1793
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
that has

1794
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,760
a way

1795
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
of heaping

1796
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,540
coals of

1797
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:45,960
fire

1798
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,880
on the

1799
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,200
heads

1800
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,620
of our

1801
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,000
enemies

1802
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
remember

1803
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,460
as a

1804
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,720
child

1805
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,100
in Sunday

1806
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,300
school

1807
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,560
when I

1808
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,760
first

1809
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,080
memorized

1810
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,500
this

1811
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,840
verse

1812
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,300
when Paul

1813
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,580
said

1814
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:52,980
if your

1815
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,260
enemy

1816
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,200
hunger

1817
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,720
feed him

1818
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,000
if he

1819
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,260
thirst

1820
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,620
give him

1821
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:55,900
drink

1822
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,220

1823
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,400
so

1824
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,640
doing

1825
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:56,820
thou

1826
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,020
shall

1827
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,220
heap

1828
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,720
coals of

1829
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:57,960
fire

1830
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,220
on his

1831
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,360
head

1832
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,460
I

1833
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,600
wonder

1834
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:58,940

coals of

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,080
fire

1838
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,440

that mean

1840
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,100
maybe some

1841
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,320
of you

1842
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,560
children

1843
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,800
wonder

1844
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,140
what does

1845
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,500
it mean

1846
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,220
coals of

1847
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,580
fire

1848
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
well again

1849
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,020
we begin

1850
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,240
to read

1851
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,740
what are

1852
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,460
the coals

1853
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,060
of fire

1854
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,500
oh it's a

1855
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,440
beautiful expression

1856
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,100
isn't it

1857
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,920
if there

1858
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,140
if there is

1859
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,160
if there is

1860
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,700
anything

1861
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,580
that will

1862
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:13,840
heap

1863
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,500
coals of

1864
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,800
fire

1865
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,260
on your

1866
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,540
enemy

1867
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,120
and mine

1868
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
it's

1869
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,300
this

1870
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,840
that when

1871
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,420
he finds

1872
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,740
that we

1873
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,320
are not

1874
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,860
returning

1875
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,480
tit for

1876
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,920
tat

1877
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
but we

1878
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,120
are going

1879
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,560
out of

1880
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,040
our way

1881
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,420
to do

1882
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:23,800
him a

1883
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,220
kindness

1884
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,940
for an

1885
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,340
evil

1886
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:25,660
thing

1887
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:25,940
that he

1888
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,380
has done

1889
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,820
us

1890
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,200
then we

1891
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,480
heap

1892
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,120
coals of

1893
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,540
fire

1894
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,060
which is

1895
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,660
an expression

1896
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,300
for we

1897
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,820
make him

1898
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,420
blush

1899
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,600
you know

1900
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,460
God made

1901
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,440
human beings

1902
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,140
with the

1903
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,820
ability

1904
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,480
to blush

1905
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,060
animals

1906
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,700
don't

1907
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,180
blush

1908
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,860
do they

1909
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,740
and this

1910
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,160
blushing

1911
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,720
is of a

1912
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,120
particular

1913
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,800
kind

1914
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,340
it's the

1915
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,780
blushing

1916
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,000
that a

1917
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,660
man does

1918
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,080
when he

1919
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,360
is thoroughly

1920
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,620
ashamed

1921
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,600
of himself

1922
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,020
if there

1923
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,540
is ever

1924
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,060
a way

1925
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,580
to make

1926
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,980
an enemy

1927
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,480
of yours

1928
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,940
and mine

1929
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,600
ashamed

1930
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,520
of himself

1931
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,780
if there

1932
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,280
is ever

1933
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,720
a way

1934
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,200
to make

1935
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,740
him feel

1936
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,660
down inside

1937
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,260
that he

1938
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,700
is the

1939
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,000
greater

1940
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,460
sinner

1941
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
it's

1942
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,020
when we

1943
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,340
give

1944
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,900
kindness

1945
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,940
in exchange

1946
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,280
for an

1947
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,620
evil

1948
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,200
turn

1949
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,440
do you

1950
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,560
ever

1951
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,040
think of

1952
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
Joseph's

1953
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,060
ten

1954
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,460
brothers

1955
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
what a

1956
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,680
scene

1957
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,180
that must

1958
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,560
have been

1959
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,840
you know

1960
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,200
when they

1961
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,760
came down

1962
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,220
to Egypt

1963
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,580
and they

1964
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,000
were after

1965
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,440
food

1966
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,080
and they

1967
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,520
did not

1968
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,040
know that

1969
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,540
the emperor

1970
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,220
the prime

1971
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,500
minister

1972
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,100
rather of

1973
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,320
Egypt

1974
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,720
was their

1975
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,040
brother

1976
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,880
and when

1977
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,360
again he

1978
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,720
had given

1979
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,160
them food

1980
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,420
and he

1981
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:22,860
lined them

1982
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,180
all up

1983
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,420
and they

1984
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,920
came down

1985
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,120
with

1986
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,560
Benjamin

1987
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,100
and Joseph

1988
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,660
was there

1989
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,340
and he

1990
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,820
was speaking

1991
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,200
to them

1992
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,740
an Egyptian

1993
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,480
and an Egyptian

1994
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,320
was interpreting

1995
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,800
to them

1996
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,260
in the Hebrew

1997
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,660
language

1998
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,100
he hadn't

1999
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,680
spoken any

2000
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,340
Hebrew to them

2001
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,180
because they

2002
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,520
thought he

2003
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,080
was an Egyptian

2004
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,620
and finally

2005
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,080
he ordered

2006
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,580
the interpreter

2007
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:35,980
and everybody

2008
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,700
out of the room

2009
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,560
and he couldn't

2010
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,320
stand it any

2011
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,660
longer

2012
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,080
and he looked

2013
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,440
at those

2014
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,760
brothers

2015
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,300
and he said

2016
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,680
I am

2017
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,100
Joseph

2018
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,500
and he

2019
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,040
spoke to

2020
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,400
them in

2021
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,760
Hebrew

2022
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,060
and he ran

2023
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,480
up and he

2024
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,780
threw his

2025
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,440
arms around

2026
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:45,920
them and he

2027
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,400
kissed them

2028
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,100
those men

2029
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,880
that again

2030
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,540
wanted to

2031
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,160
kill him

2032
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,500
can you

2033
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,260
imagine

2034
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,680
ten men

2035
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,240
that ever

2036
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,300
blushed more

2037
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,120
in life

2038
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,720
than his

2039
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,420
ten brothers

2040
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,820
Benjamin

2041
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,620
was not in

2042
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,160
or he didn't

2043
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,860
have to blush

2044
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,720
can you

2045
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,120
imagine

2046
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,880
the coals

2047
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,360
of fire

2048
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,760
that were

2049
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,120
heaped

2050
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,680
on those

2051
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,200
men's

2052
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,520
heads

2053
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,940
ten of

2054
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,100
them

2055
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,860
when they

2056
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,400
stood there

2057
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,700
and here

2058
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,220
was a brother

2059
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,880
kissing them

2060
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,300
and loving

2061
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,540
them

2062
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,020
and forgiving

2063
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,320
them

2064
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,120
after the

2065
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,940
dirty deals

2066
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,300
that they

2067
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,860
had given

2068
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,380
him

2069
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,740
oh again

2070
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,460
they turned

2071
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:13,880
to him

2072
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,120
and they

2073
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,680
just couldn't

2074
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,280
believe it

2075
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,800
could they

2076
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,560
they admitted

2077
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,300
they were

2078
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,780
the big

2079
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,200
sinners

2080
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,920
if there's

2081
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,680
ever anything

2082
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,180
that'll make

2083
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,980
a man ashamed

2084
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,740
of himself

2085
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,900
and come to

2086
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,540
his senses

2087
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,280
it is again

2088
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,020
when we can

2089
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
return an evil

2090
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,540
deed with a

2091
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,860
kindness

2092
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,920
and we can

2093
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,620
cause a man

2094
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,240
to blush

2095
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,700
within

2096
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,080
and it

2097
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,680
comes from

2098
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,380
within himself

2099
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,880
that he says

2100
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm the

2101
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,820
greater sinner

2102
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,900
just like

2103
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,500
King Saul

2104
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,180
told David

2105
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,500
he said

2106
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,020
I sin

2107
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,480
more than

2108
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,760
you

2109
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,500
and then

2110
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:38,940
you talk

2111
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,560
about joy

2112
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,040
what's there

2113
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,340
to lose

2114
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,600
listen

2115
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,160
the joy

2116
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,060
that if a

2117
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,040
man turns

2118
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,640
and comes

2119
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,300
to Christ

2120
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,860
there is

2121
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,600
this joy

2122
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,520
that we've

2123
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,500
had a part

2124
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:47,840
in it

2125
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,140
do you know

2126
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,420
of any

2127
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,060
greater joy

2128
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,620
than to see

2129
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,080
an enemy

2130
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
because we

2131
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,000
have gone

2132
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,500
out of our

2133
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,900
way to

2134
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,140
treating

2135
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,780
with kindness

2136
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,080
because we

2137
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,920
have conquered

2138
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,800
a spirit

2139
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,760
of vindictiveness

2140
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,340
within our

2141
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,980
own soul

2142
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,920
do you know

2143
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,460
of any joy

2144
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,140
that is greater

2145
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,660
than to see

2146
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,300
somebody turn

2147
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,820
to Christ

2148
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,180
and supposing he

2149
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,740
doesn't

2150
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,640
there is still

2151
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,620
this satisfaction

2152
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,380
that his blood

2153
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,060
isn't on your

2154
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,860
soul and mine

2155
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,140
you and I

2156
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,900
don't want any

2157
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,860
soul loss

2158
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,260
because ours

2159
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,080
was a case of

2160
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,020
tit for tat

2161
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,400
regardless of

2162
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,100
what the injury

2163
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,000
was regardless

2164
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,020
of how justified

2165
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,960
we may feel

2166
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,200
that a spirit

2167
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,980
of vindication

2168
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,880
and vindictiveness

2169
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,140
is justified

2170
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,740
on our

2171
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,240
part

2172
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,400
oh again

2173
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,180
this is

2174
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,680
Christianity

2175
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,600
in its

2176
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,740
finest hour

2177
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,280
it is applied

2178
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,000
Christianity

2179
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,680
to the

2180
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,200
Christian

2181
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,240
it is

2182
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,800
Christian

2183
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,660
psychology

2184
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,760
in its

2185
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,640
most glorious

2186
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
beauty

2187
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,780
and that's

2188
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,480
why today

2189
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,260
yes

2190
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,040
20 years

2191
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,680
ago today

2192
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,180
the first

2193
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,720
service went

2194
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,320
out over the

2195
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,620
air

2196
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,680
and today

2197
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,880
as again

2198
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,560
we dedicate

2199
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
ourselves

2200
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,260
that we are

2201
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,760
going to

2202
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,200
conquer

2203
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,260
within ourselves

2204
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,960
a spirit

2205
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,720
of revenge

2206
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,520
a spirit

2207
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:52,940
of getting

2208
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,480
even with

2209
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,840
others

2210
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,880
we are going

2211
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,280
to do it

2212
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,160
by repaying

2213
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,580
an evil

2214
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,100
turn with

2215
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,540
a good

2216
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,060
turn

2217
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,880
then we

2218
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,220
ought to

2219
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,560
today

2220
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,060
we're ready

2221
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,580
to thank

2222
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:00,980
God

2223
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,660
for the

2224
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,080
privilege

2225
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,660
that we

2226
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,300
have had

2227
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,260
of broadcasting

2228
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,000
every Sunday

2229
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,060
there were two

2230
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,860
things I had

2231
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,360
in mind

2232
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,860
when we went

2233
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,500
on the air

2234
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,480
the first

2235
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,280
thing was

2236
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,760
certainly a

2237
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,160
conviction

2238
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,700
and that was

2239
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,020
this

2240
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,880
that if we

2241
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,180
were going

2242
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,720
to broadcast

2243
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,480
as Emmanuel

2244
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,060
Lutheran Church

2245
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,560
it was going

2246
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,040
to be done

2247
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,880
without ever

2248
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,700
at any time

2249
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,520
asking for

2250
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,940
money

2251
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,680
or for

2252
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,140
donation

2253
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,640
over the

2254
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:20,920
air

2255
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,380
no time

2256
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,960
did I want

2257
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,360
anybody

2258
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,760
who was

2259
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,100
listening

2260
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,440
to say

2261
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,000
this is a

2262
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,340
gimmick

2263
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,760
all they're

2264
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,360
interested in

2265
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,680
is our

2266
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,340
pocketbook

2267
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,440
and thank

2268
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,860
God

2269
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,420
and credit

2270
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,740
to you

2271
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,040
as a

2272
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,640
congregation

2273
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,160
for 20

2274
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,440
years

2275
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,840
you have

2276
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,320
nobly

2277
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,900
supported

2278
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,120
the radio

2279
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,600
fund

2280
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,980
of this

2281
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,680
congregation

2282
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,660
oh yes

2283
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,320
gifts have

2284
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,820
come in

2285
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,700
to be sure

2286
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,220
and far

2287
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,560
be it

2288
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,880
from me

2289
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,260
to say

2290
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,600
that they

2291
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,160
have not

2292
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,860
but no

2293
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,140
gift

2294
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,540
has ever

2295
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,120
come in

2296
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,740
but what

2297
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,280
it came

2298
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,760
from the

2299
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,020
giver

2300
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,600
who wanted

2301
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,260
to give

2302
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,280
not even

2303
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
by innuendo

2304
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,840
has it

2305
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,280
ever been

2306
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,040
inferred

2307
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,680
that we

2308
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,240
ever wanted

2309
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,940
anybody to

2310
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,400
send us

2311
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,980
one nickel

2312
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,900
because this

2313
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,520
was to be

2314
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,200
our gift

2315
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
and our

2316
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,700
privilege to

2317
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,300
our community

2318
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,740
and the other

2319
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,500
thing was this

2320
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,780
at no time

2321
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,360
did I ever

2322
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,080
want the radio

2323
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,920
broadcast to

2324
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,380
mean this

2325
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
that you in the

2326
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,820
church would

2327
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,400
feel that you

2328
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,280
were spectators

2329
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,840
and that this

2330
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,660
was a broadcast

2331
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,340
no

2332
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,460
as you know

2333
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,260
for 20 years

2334
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,820
the point of

2335
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,440
view has been

2336
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,380
I'm talking

2337
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,100
to you

2338
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,980
in the church

2339
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,180
and the radio

2340
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,000
audience therefore

2341
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,900
is part of the

2342
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,480
congregation

2343
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,860
they are

2344
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,300
listening

2345
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,100
you are

2346
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,420
not

2347
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,400
spectators

2348
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,560
you are

2349
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,080
here as

2350
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,660
worshippers

2351
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,520
in God's

2352
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:22,920
house

2353
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
and as we

2354
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,500
look back

2355
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,040
over 20

2356
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,540
years who

2357
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,020
knew whether

2358
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,240
it would

2359
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,680
last I

2360
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,160
didn't know

2361
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,620
how long

2362
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,880
it would

2363
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,400
last we

2364
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,940
were told

2365
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,780
that within

2366
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,280
two weeks

2367
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,760
you'll find

2368
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,220
out whether

2369
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,040
the community

2370
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,680
will accept

2371
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,220
it or not

2372
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,760
by the grace

2373
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,360
of God it

2374
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,840
has been

2375
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,340
accepted

2376
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,400
well there

2377
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,560
have been

2378
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:36,980
some very

2379
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,020
fine experiences

2380
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,840
to be sure

2381
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,380
individuals who

2382
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:40,860
have written

2383
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,540
who have said

2384
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:41,940
that I've

2385
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,460
come to know

2386
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,980
Christ

2387
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,800
I have

2388
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,220
gone to

2389
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,620
the church

2390
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:44,960
in my

2391
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,500
community

2392
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,860
individuals who

2393
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,260
have written

2394
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,600
have said

2395
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,140
we've wandered

2396
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,680
away from

2397
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,920
God and

2398
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,260
we have

2399
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,740
heard the

2400
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,160
word and

2401
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,520
we've come

2402
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,120
back and

2403
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,540
we've gone

2404
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,120
back into

2405
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,780
church life

2406
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,140
and we've

2407
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,480
come back

2408
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,960
to Jesus

2409
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,520
Christ

2410
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,860
I remember

2411
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,380
the one

2412
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,400
again the

2413
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,080
one time

2414
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,340
when I was

2415
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,180
speaking about

2416
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,800
suicide

2417
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,080
by the grace

2418
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,680
of God

2419
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,420
and by his

2420
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,060
providence

2421
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,180
when after

2422
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,780
that Sunday

2423
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,460
I received

2424
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:07,800
a letter

2425
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,300
from a young

2426
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,780
lady who

2427
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,740
said life

2428
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,860
came to me

2429
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,460
to be something

2430
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,180
unbearable

2431
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,820
I didn't want

2432
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,300
any more of

2433
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,520
it

2434
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,940
said I went

2435
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,260
into the

2436
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,520
kitchen

2437
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,060
I turned

2438
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,440
on the

2439
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,880
gas

2440
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,440
and the

2441
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,780
stove

2442
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,040
and I

2443
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,320
had it

2444
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,920
all on

2445
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
I closed

2446
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,600
the door

2447
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,260
and I was

2448
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,920
ready to go

2449
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,720
I just

2450
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,360
didn't want

2451
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,840
life

2452
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,300
and said I

2453
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,960
didn't tune

2454
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,420
you in

2455
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:25,800
I just

2456
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,260
happened to

2457
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,240
have WMRN

2458
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,620
on

2459
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,060
and so

2460
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,660
happened that

2461
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,340
you came on

2462
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:30,980
as a sermon

2463
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,380
and you were

2464
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,160
talking about

2465
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,380
taking one's

2466
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:33,960
life getting

2467
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,020
so despondent

2468
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,780
and so depressed

2469
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,500
and you said

2470
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,620
that no man

2471
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,180
has the right

2472
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,680
to take his

2473
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,280
own life

2474
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,460
and she said

2475
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,260
there I stood

2476
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,640
and I

2477
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,140
wondered

2478
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,840
and I thought

2479
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,480
well here God

2480
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,580
is talking to me

2481
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,920
and I turned

2482
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,880
the gas burners

2483
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,620
off and she

2484
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,420
wrote a very

2485
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,140
fine letter

2486
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,680
and said

2487
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,020
thank you

2488
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,680
by the grace

2489
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,200
of God

2490
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,840
that there is

2491
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,500
still something

2492
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,080
to life

2493
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,620
and I am

2494
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,300
still living

2495
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,940
and some of you

2496
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,560
who have said

2497
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,080
this

2498
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,300
you have said

2499
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,640
well the last

2500
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,540
sermon my husband

2501
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,360
or my wife

2502
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,000
heard on earth

2503
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,720
came from the

2504
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,040
church

2505
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,600
they weren't

2506
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,200
able to go

2507
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,620
anymore

2508
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,740
but we were

2509
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,340
able to worship

2510
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,000
together and we

2511
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,740
sat at the radio

2512
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,540
and we sang the

2513
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,300
hymns with you

2514
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,380
and we prayed

2515
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,000
with you

2516
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,020
and that's why

2517
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,580
again there's

2518
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,340
always been this

2519
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,260
thrill that somewhere

2520
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,120
in the sermon I

2521
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,600
realize that because

2522
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,700
I am talking to

2523
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
some who may

2524
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,660
never again hear

2525
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,520
the word of God

2526
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,240
who may be at

2527
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,800
death's door

2528
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,280
that there might be

2529
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,080
some comfort

2530
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,280
and some strength

2531
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,220
and that they

2532
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,160
might see the glory

2533
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,300
of Jesus Christ

2534
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,380
and that knowing

2535
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,180
him they might

2536
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,520
know that again

2537
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,300
even though death

2538
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,640
comes it's the

2539
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,520
gateway to life

2540
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,320
and to everlasting

2541
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,200
salvation

2542
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,300
that's the joy

2543
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,520
of preaching

2544
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,240
there's hardly a

2545
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,960
week goes by

2546
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,540
when I go out

2547
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,080
to the hospital

2548
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,820
somebody puts

2549
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,580
my name down

2550
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,240
I don't know

2551
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,340
them and I

2552
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:47,880
say to them

2553
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,100
yes I'm estranged

2554
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,580
and say well you

2555
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,240
don't know but

2556
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,760
you've been my

2557
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,640
minister for 10

2558
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,520
years 12 years

2559
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,160
whatever the case

2560
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,660
may be

2561
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,740
I haven't been

2562
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,340
able to go to

2563
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,400
church and I

2564
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,160
listen you're the

2565
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,020
only minister I

2566
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,460
know and so by

2567
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,440
the grace of God

2568
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,500
again we don't

2569
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,400
know in its small

2570
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
way what 20

2571
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,680
years of broadcasting

2572
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,380
the word of God

2573
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,160
is done but we

2574
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,540
do know this that

2575
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,320
God's word never

2576
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,200
returns void we

2577
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,940
do know that only

2578
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,900
eternity can tell

2579
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,600
the story but for

2580
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,540
this we do thank

2581
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,380
God it's been a

2582
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,980
privilege a privilege

2583
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,660
to be sure to

2584
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,380
warm hearts to

2585
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,040
show men the

2586
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,780
glory of Jesus

2587
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,620
Christ and to

2588
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,220
know this that

2589
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,160
when God's word

2590
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,020
is preached as

2591
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,920
it certainly has

2592
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,460
been from the

2593
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,000
depths of my

2594
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,860
soul my desire

2595
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,600
to preach it

2596
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,060
that soldier one

2597
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,260
for Jesus Christ

2598
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,880
and God's truth

2599
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,000
marches on

2600
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
if souls have

2601
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,580
been warmed and

2602
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,480
some eyes have

2603
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,380
seen the glory of

2604
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,180
God it's more

2605
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,360
than pay is it

2606
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,000
not and today on

2607
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,140
the 20th anniversary

2608
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,880
we owe to God

2609
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,460
that we could go

2610
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,160
out of God's

2611
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,880
house today and

2612
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,700
we could say I'm

2613
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,120
leaving behind this

2614
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,420
morning a spirit of

2615
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,260
revenge there is no

2616
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,760
gloating and I

2617
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,940
promise the Lord in

2618
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,880
my life from this

2619
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,060
day on because I
