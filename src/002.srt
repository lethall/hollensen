1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,560
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,300
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in Paul's letter to the Galatians,

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,620
our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday in the fourth chapter, particularly the 31st verse.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:26,300
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:33,720
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,600
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,140
In Christ Jesus, the Lord of his church, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,100
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:03,140
It was while St. Paul was on his first missionary journey that he came into the region of Galatia.

10
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,860
You recall that he was with Barnabas.

11
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,360
When they come up into that territory there in Asia Minor,

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,820
cities located there, Antioch and Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe,

13
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,040
Paul found a number of Jews up in that territory,

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,420
and he treats Christ to them as the Messiah and as the Savior,

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,380
and a number of Jews became Christians.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
And then later on, this is what happened.

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,240
There came false teachers amongst these Jewish Christians,

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,680
telling them that they were not to put their hope of salvation in Christ and in him alone,

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,800
but that rather they were to go back to the law,

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,380
that they were to put their hope of salvation in doing good,

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,620
in trying to keep the Ten Commandments,

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,820
in trying to obey the law that God had given them.

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,440
And so it was that Paul, in order to refute this argument

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,840
and to keep them in Christ as the way of salvation,

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,600
he wrote this letter to the Christians up in the Galatian territory.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,340
And this is what he told them.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,340
He said, you who are being tempted to go back to the law,

28
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,620
to feeling that you're going to be saved by means of obeying the Ten Commandments,

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,160
he said, do you not read what the Scriptures say about the law?

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,340
And then Paul went on and he told them, he says,

31
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,460
remember how the Scriptures talk about Abraham who had two sons?

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,940
And I am sure that you recall that story.

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,900
You remember that God picked Abraham and told Abraham

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,540
that he was to be the father of a great nation,

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,240
and that in him and in his seed all the nations of the earth were going to be blessed.

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
But the problem was Abraham had no children, he had no son.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,260
And time went on and he still didn't have a son

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,580
until finally his wife Sarah became rather impatient.

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,780
And she said to Abraham, Abraham, take this slave girl that we have.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,940
Her name was Hagar.

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
And she said, have a child by her.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,820
So Abraham did that.

43
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,160
And Hagar became the mother of a child from Abraham.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,980
And as you know, they called his name Ishmael.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,320
But again, because Hagar was a slave mother,

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,740
she was able to bring into this world only a slave son.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,760
And that slave son, because he was a slave son, was cast out.

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,400
Now we know this, that later on what happened,

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,080
at the time when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90 years old,

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,680
then God came to the rescue and God blessed Sarah with the child.

51
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,700
And because Sarah was a free woman, not a slave woman,

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,700
therefore that son Isaac that was born of Sarah was a free son.

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,680
And he was not cast out.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,060
He inherited the blessing as God had intended.

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,380
And so then Paul went on telling the Galatian Christians,

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,280
he said, now there is another meaning in this historic fact

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,060
that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond woman,

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,660
a slave woman, and the other by a free woman.

59
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,020
He said, these two mothers represent the two covenants

60
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,200
or the two agreements that God has made with his children.

61
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,340
And then he went on to say, now Hagar, who was the slave mother,

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,000
she represents Mount Sinai.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,500
She represents Mount Sinai where the law was given.

64
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,880
And then Paul makes this great point.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,260
Just as Hagar, a slave mother, could produce only slaves to be cast out,

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,340
so Paul reminds him, remember Mount Sinai can produce only slave sons

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,960
who are lost sons, who are cast out.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,680
And so then it follows that Sarah, who is the free mother,

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,580
she represents another mountain,

70
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,860
the other covenant that God has made,

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,520
the other agreement, and that agreement is Mount Calvary in Jerusalem.

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,840
And Mount Calvary, therefore, because that represents Sarah,

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,060
here is again the mountain that produces free children,

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
that produces saved souls.

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
And then it was that when Paul was pleading with the Galatians,

76
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,700
he calls upon them to rejoice, Galatian Christians,

77
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,380
rejoice that as Christians, that you are not sons of Mount Sinai,

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,340
slaves and lost souls.

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,380
Rejoice, he says, that you are sons of Mount Calvary,

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,560
that you are free, that you are saved souls, not lost souls.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
And so through this same word of God, Paul speaks to you and me today as Christians.

82
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,340
And this is Laetare Sunday, the Sunday to rejoice.

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,620
And we are asked as Christians to rejoice in this,

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,000
that you and I as Christians are not sons of Mount Sinai.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,780
We are not sons who are trying to save ourselves by means of obeying the law.

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,100
That we are not sons of Mount Sinai, therefore slaves and lost sons.

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,260
We are called upon today to rejoice that we are sons of Mount Calvary,

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,020
that we are free sons, that we are saved souls.

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,520
And I am sure that that leaves a number of problems within your mind and mine.

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,060
And we may say to ourselves, it's hard to believe

91
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,780
that we as Christians are to rejoice in the fact

92
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,700
that we are not sons of Mount Sinai and thus lost sons,

93
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,100
that we are sons of Mount Calvary and thus saved sons,

94
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,300
because we may say for the life of us, we can't understand why

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,760
sons of Mount Sinai are lost sons.

96
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,680
That's a hard thing to understand, isn't it?

97
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,040
We say to ourselves, why is it that a person who really wants to be good,

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,680
why is it that a person who is really sincere,

99
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
why is it the person that says,

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm going to try to keep the Ten Commandments to the very extent of my ability,

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,260
why is it that a person that says,

102
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,020
I'm going to obey the Ten Commandments to the very best that I can do,

103
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
why is it that that person is lost?

104
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,560
Why is it that that person is a slave and is lost?

105
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,260
You and I say, isn't there a road to heaven from Mount Sinai

106
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,240
just as well as there is a road to heaven from Mount Calvary?

107
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,760
Isn't it possible that a person who wants to do what is right,

108
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,180
who wants to obey the Ten Commandments,

109
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,980
who wants to be a son of Mount Sinai?

110
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,380
Isn't it possible for that person to go to heaven

111
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,600
just as well as the person that stands at Mount Calvary,

112
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
who is a free son?

113
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,640
Isn't there a road that leads to heaven from Mount Sinai,

114
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,880
the law, as there is a road that leads from Mount Calvary?

115
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Well, this morning, will you do this for me?

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,720
Let's imagine that we're all standing before two mountains.

117
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,420
Here is Mount Sinai that represents Hagar or the Ten Commandments.

118
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,960
Here is Mount Sinai where people are standing

119
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
who look at Mount Sinai and say,

120
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,380
I want a way to heaven from Mount Sinai.

121
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to believe that I can be saved by doing the best that I know how,

122
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,220
by living a moral life according to the Ten Commandments,

123
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,460
by obeying the law.

124
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,600
And then here is Mount Calvary.

125
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Here is Mount Calvary where, again, there are free sons

126
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,840
and here are the saved souls.

127
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,520
Will you just look at these mountains for a moment and listen to this?

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,200
You may ask,

129
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,900
Is there a road leading to heaven from Mount Sinai?

130
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,760
And may I say this,

131
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,340
and I hope to God I can write it on your hearts that you'll never forget it,

132
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,220
there is no road leading to heaven from Mount Sinai.

133
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,360
There is no road leading to heaven there.

134
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
There never has been.

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,140
There never will be a road to heaven from Mount Sinai.

136
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,380
Will you remember that as long as you live?

137
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,500
And here is Mount Calvary.

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,000
There is a road to heaven from Mount Calvary.

139
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,520
It is there.

140
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,400
There is only one road,

141
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,980
and it leads from Mount Calvary.

142
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,660
But there is a road there.

143
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,640
But may I write it on your hearts this morning,

144
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,900
there never is,

145
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,540
there never was,

146
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,700
there never will be

147
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,760
a road to heaven

148
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,620
from Mount Sinai.

149
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,280
And that's why Paul calls upon you and me this morning

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
to rejoice as Christians

151
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,940
that we are not sons of Mount Sinai.

152
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,600
We are not lost souls.

153
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,120
But as Christians,

154
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
we are sons of Mount Calvary.

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,460
We are saved souls

156
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,380
because sons of Mount Sinai are lost.

157
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,020
There is no road to heaven from Mount Sinai.

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,200
You wonder why?

159
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,800
Let's look for a moment.

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,480
Let's stand.

161
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,400
Don't forget we're standing before two mountains this morning,

162
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
Mount Sinai and Mount Calvary.

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,640
When we look at Mount Sinai,

164
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,420
bear this in mind,

165
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,720
that Mount Sinai demands perfection of us.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
Mount Calvary gives perfection.

167
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,740
You may say that's strange

168
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,120
that there's no road to heaven

169
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,260
leading from Mount Sinai.

170
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,740
We may say why it was a wonderful incident

171
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,380
when God gave the law to Mount Sinai.

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
It really was.

173
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,500
When God gave the law to Mount Sinai,

174
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,960
to be sure,

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
it was a wonderful occurrence

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,120
that Moses had led the children of Israel,

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,420
you remember,

178
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,360
out of the land of Egypt

179
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
and they crossed the Red Sea

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,780
and they came to Mount Sinai in Arabia.

181
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,480
And there it was that God said,

182
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:19,940
Get ready.

183
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,800
And on that one day of days,

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,020
God spoke from the mountain

185
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,420
and it trembled in the earthquake

186
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,480
and there were storms again,

187
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,600
thunder and lightnings

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,940
and a cloud filled the mountain.

189
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,560
And the Lord God spoke.

190
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,360
But listen,

191
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,620
what did he say?

192
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,820
I am the Lord thy God.

193
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,040
It was a great day.

194
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,840
But listen,

195
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,840
when God at Mount Sinai

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
gave the Ten Commandments,

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,440
bear in mind

198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
that it was a God of perfection calling

199
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
and it was a God who was saying,

200
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,220
I am the Almighty God.

201
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,560
walk before me

202
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,960
and be thou perfect.

203
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,420
Mount Sinai demands

204
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,320
nothing short of perfection.

205
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,740
And when you and I

206
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,040
stand at Mount Sinai this morning,

207
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,320
listen,

208
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,040
God says,

209
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,980
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

210
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,880
God says,

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,740
I want to be first,

212
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,220
last and always in your life.

213
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,280
You must do my will at all times

214
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,840
and never fail in one point

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,220
because the law says,

216
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,660
whosoever shall keep the whole law

217
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,320
and yet offend in one point

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
is guilty of having broken the entire law.

219
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,260
We stand at Mount Sinai

220
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,580
and listen to what God says,

221
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,960
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord

222
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,860
thy God in vain.

223
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,680
God says,

224
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,140
never use my name foolishly.

225
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,780
You must use it.

226
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,360
Never must you ever use it in vain.

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,560
I demand perfection,

228
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,820
not just your best.

229
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,900
I demand perfection.

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
And you and I stand

231
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,980
in the mountain

232
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,480
that's trembling.

233
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,940
God says,

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
remember the Sabbath day

235
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,620
to keep it holy.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,380
God says,

237
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,520
you've got to worship me

238
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
and you've got to honor me

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,500
in perfection.

240
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,640
God says,

241
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,140
honor thy father and thy mother.

242
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,560
God demands perfection,

243
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,920
not just your best and mine.

244
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:42,840
God says,

245
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,880
thou shalt not kill,

246
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
till no hatred there shall be,

247
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,180
no hatred and ill will in your hearts.

248
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,980
God says,

249
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,760
I demand no less than perfection

250
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
at Mount Sinai.

251
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,300
Thou shalt not commit adultery,

252
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,320
not even one evil thought and desire.

253
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,340
God says,

254
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,340
thou shalt not steal honesty,

255
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,360
perfect absolute honesty

256
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,300
in all things.

257
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,100
Thou shalt not bear false witness

258
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,940
against thy neighbor.

259
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,780
God says,

260
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,760
you must never lie

261
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,900
and then you must speak the truth

262
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,200
and speak it only in love.

263
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
I demand nothing less than perfection.

264
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,480
And God says,

265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,080
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.

266
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,700
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife,

267
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,500
nor his man's servant,

268
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,280
nor his maid's servant,

269
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,820
nor his cattle,

270
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,900
nor anything that is thy neighbor's.

271
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,780
God says,

272
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,080
you dare not have

273
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
even one evil desire,

274
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,580
not one sin of jealousy,

275
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,900
not one sin of envy.

276
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
And you and I stand

277
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
and we say Mount Sinai

278
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,600
is a marvelous mountain.

279
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,100
But listen,

280
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,160
it demands perfection.

281
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
And when you and I

282
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,500
do not measure up to its demands,

283
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,920
it says you and I are guilty.

284
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,600
Every man that stands

285
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
at Mount Sinai,

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
which is the law,

287
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,540
stands as a guilty sinner

288
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,380
before God.

289
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,960
Having broken the law,

290
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,500
we all stand as lawbreakers.

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Listen,

292
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,600
why is it

293
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,540
that those who stand

294
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,560
at Mount Sinai,

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
those who are ever so sincere,

296
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,840
those who are ever so good,

297
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,320
who stand at Mount Sinai

298
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,640
and say there must be a way

299
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,160
to heaven from Mount Sinai,

300
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,940
believing that that's the way

301
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,100
to heaven and eternal life,

302
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,020
but nevertheless,

303
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,920
they are lost sinners

304
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,940
and they are absolutely lost.

305
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,520
Why?

306
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,140
There isn't any road

307
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,080
leading to heaven

308
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,680
from Mount Sinai.

309
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,040
How could there be?

310
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,800
Because no man stands perfect.

311
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,480
But oh God,

312
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,800
when you turn to the other mountain,

313
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,660
to Mount Calvary,

314
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,220
now something's different.

315
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,100
There's a Christ

316
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,220
at Mount Calvary.

317
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,940
You notice there isn't any Christ

318
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,780
at Mount Sinai.

319
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,680
I never was,

320
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,780
never will be.

321
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,880
But there's a Christ

322
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,300
over here at Mount Calvary

323
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,740
and you and I look at him

324
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,140
and we say,

325
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,680
who is he?

326
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Why, he's no less than God the Son.

327
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,240
He's no less than God,

328
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,940
a very God

329
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,720
and King of kings

330
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,500
and Lord of lords

331
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,380
who came out of the ivory palaces

332
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,680
into this world of sin.

333
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,160
And on Calvary,

334
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,360
yes, on the cross,

335
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,540
he was the one

336
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,240
who again,

337
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,600
he bore again

338
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,420
the law of God.

339
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,900
He fulfilled it perfectly.

340
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:49,960
In thought,

341
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,260
word,

342
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,660
in deed,

343
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,440
he stood before

344
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,460
the world of his day

345
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,920
and no man was ever able

346
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,680
to convince him

347
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,540
that he had sinned

348
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,700
and because he is

349
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,660
no less than God

350
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,260
when he kept the Ten Commandments,

351
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,020
he kept them for you and me.

352
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,220
When you stand

353
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,680
at Mount Calvary, sinner,

354
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,300
there comes some Christ

355
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,860
who says,

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
here is the perfection

357
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,240
that Mount Sinai demands

358
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
but can't give.

359
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
I give you my perfection

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,160
as the Son of God

361
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,200
because I kept

362
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,580
the Ten Commandments for you.

363
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,100
Isn't it marvelous?

364
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,480
And listen,

365
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,220
there's a road

366
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,240
that leads to heaven

367
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
from Mount Calvary.

368
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,020
There never was.

369
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,920
There is not

370
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,380
and there never will be

371
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,840
a road leading to heaven

372
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
from Mount Sinai.

373
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,820
And if I could write that

374
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,980
on your souls this morning,

375
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,260
listen,

376
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,640
today we ought to thank God

377
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,300
that as Christians

378
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,860
that we are not sons

379
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,480
of Mount Sinai.

380
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,260
We are not sons of Hagar.

381
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,300
We are not slaves,

382
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,700
condemned sinners.

383
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,420
We are sons of Sarah

384
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,720
standing at Mount Calvary.

385
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,180
We are free and saved.

386
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,460
And if we could say,

387
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,360
we are there,

388
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,600
why?

389
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,960
Knowing that there is no road

390
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,940
that leads to Mount Sinai,

391
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,160
then we ought to be able

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,060
to understand this more.

393
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,960
Well, then why did God

394
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,260
ever give Mount Sinai anyhow?

395
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,680
Many a man says,

396
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,540
well, if there's no road

397
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,100
leading to heaven

398
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,980
from Mount Sinai,

399
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,080
why in the name of goodness

400
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,520
did God ever give

401
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,700
the law at Mount Sinai?

402
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,040
Well, listen, friend,

403
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,760
that isn't the first

404
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
that God gave the law,

405
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,040
the law of the Ten Commandments,

406
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,140
why it was given

407
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,980
back in creation

408
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,860
when God wrote it

409
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,600
in man's heart

410
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,460
in the Garden of Eden.

411
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,760
But man lost it

412
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,640
when man sinned.

413
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,380
And here at Mount Sinai,

414
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,760
God repeated the law

415
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,200
and what was its purpose?

416
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,140
It was never intended

417
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,760
to be a way of salvation.

418
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,060
It couldn't have been

419
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,340
no more than God

420
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,100
ever intended

421
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,160
for Ishmael

422
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,640
to be the forerunner

423
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,300
of Christ.

424
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,140
God never intended

425
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,960
that Hagar

426
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,320
should ever give birth

427
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,500
to a slave son

428
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,740
and that Ishmael

429
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,720
should be the seed

430
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,500
from whom Christ

431
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,000
would come.

432
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,300
God never intended that.

433
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,900
God's intention was

434
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,520
that Sarah

435
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,480
should have a son

436
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
and that Sarah's son

437
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,660
Isaac should be

438
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,920
the progenitor of Jesus

439
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,740
and that he would

440
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,500
come from Isaac,

441
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,740
not from Ishmael.

442
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,980
No more than that.

443
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,440
But you say,

444
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,180
well, if the law

445
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,920
at Mount Sinai

446
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,740
was never given

447
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,220
to save,

448
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,940
that there's no road

449
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,100
to heaven,

450
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,120
what did God give it for?

451
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,220
Why, the Bible

452
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,340
answers it very simply.

453
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,700
The law, again,

454
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,560
by the law

455
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,720
is the knowledge of sin.

456
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,800
God gave Mount Sinai

457
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,220
for this big reason

458
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,300
that you and I

459
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,140
might stand

460
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,180
at Mount Sinai

461
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,060
and even though

462
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,980
we would come and say,

463
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm going to try

464
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,420
to keep it,

465
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm going to try

466
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,700
to live,

467
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,860
that we would soon see

468
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
because it demands

469
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,320
perfection,

470
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,180
that we can't keep it,

471
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,140
that you and I

472
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,960
would begin to see

473
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,100
ourselves as lost

474
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
and condemned sinners,

475
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,780
that before Mount Sinai

476
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,400
we would see

477
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,100
that we're guilty,

478
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,480
that we don't measure up,

479
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,860
and that seeing it

480
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,460
in horror

481
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,600
we would race

482
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,980
from Mount Sinai

483
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,040
over to Calvary

484
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,600
to see the need

485
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,220
of a Savior.

486
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,120
You know,

487
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,720
if there was no

488
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,400
Mount Sinai,

489
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,820
you and I

490
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,260
would never have

491
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,520
any consciousness of sin.

492
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,060
We'd never realize

493
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,860
that we are sinners

494
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,720
and that we are guilty.

495
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,320
The law was given

496
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,340
to show us

497
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,420
our need of a Savior.

498
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
And yet isn't it strange,

499
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,060
I wonder how many

500
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,780
that I'm talking to

501
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,200
this morning

502
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,760
stand before Mount Sinai

503
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,620
and oh,

504
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,400
you get the greatest

505
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,260
comfort out of it.

506
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,960
You love it.

507
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,200
You stand there,

508
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,320
how many people say,

509
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,600
my religion,

510
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,920
my religion is to do good,

511
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,600
my religion is to keep

512
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,160
the law,

513
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,840
and oh,

514
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,720
you stand and you say,

515
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:02,880
oh,

516
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,660
I thank you Lord

517
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,540
that I'm a lot better

518
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,560
than other people are,

519
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,480
and you stand at Mount Sinai

520
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,860
and you've got the assurance

521
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,720
that you're saved

522
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,520
because again,

523
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,080
you are doing the best

524
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,980
that you know how.

525
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,300
Listen friend,

526
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,220
what can I tell you?

527
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,500
There isn't any road

528
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,160
to heaven at Mount Sinai.

529
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,140
How in the name of God

530
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,280
can you stand there

531
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,160
and get comfort

532
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,980
out of something

533
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,140
that tells you

534
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,440
that you're a guilty sinner?

535
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,280
You've got to

536
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,520
misinterpret the law.

537
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,600
How many this morning,

538
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,740
you're sincere,

539
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,380
oh heaven,

540
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,700
yes,

541
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
you're sincere,

542
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,840
but you're standing

543
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,520
before Mount Sinai

544
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,720
and you think

545
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
that you're saved,

546
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,780
but listen friend,

547
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,800
believe me,

548
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,560
there isn't any road

549
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
that goes to heaven

550
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,340
from Mount Sinai.

551
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,280
It was never intended

552
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,040
to save

553
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
and it'll never save you.

554
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,580
It'll never save me.

555
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
It can't.

556
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,200
It demands perfection.

557
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,740
There's no Christ there.

558
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,660
Will you remember that?

559
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
No wonder when Paul

560
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
wrote to the Galatians

561
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,440
and they were in danger

562
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,160
of leaving Mount Calvary

563
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,740
and they were going

564
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,660
back to Sinai

565
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,520
and they were going

566
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,620
to base their salvation

567
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,700
on obeying the law,

568
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,520
doing what the law

569
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,120
would require.

570
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,220
And Paul wrote,

571
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,860
heaven forbid,

572
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,060
rejoice in the fact,

573
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,860
Galatians,

574
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,240
that because you're Christians,

575
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,140
that again,

576
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,080
you are not sons

577
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,880
of Mount Sinai.

578
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,060
You're not slaves.

579
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,060
You're not lost.

580
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,820
You're sons of Mount Calvary.

581
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,380
You're free.

582
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,100
You're saved.

583
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,520
And you and I may say,

584
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
well, oh why is it

585
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,940
it's so hard to believe

586
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,500
that somebody

587
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,120
that stands at Mount Sinai

588
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,520
who is so sincere

589
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,760
and tries to fulfill it,

590
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,100
it's so hard to believe

591
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,960
that they're lost.

592
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,660
Well, listen,

593
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,040
they're lost for this reason.

594
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,740
There just isn't any way

595
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,260
to heaven from Mount Sinai.

596
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,640
There never was.

597
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,580
There never will be.

598
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,240
Why?

599
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,540
Look at Mount Sinai again.

600
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,080
Mount Sinai not only

601
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,000
demands perfection,

602
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,300
but look,

603
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,940
Mount Sinai condemns you and me,

604
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,840
condemns us to hell.

605
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,900
Every last one of us.

606
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,040
Mount Calvary rescues us from hell.

607
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,000
Look at Mount Sinai.

608
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,980
If you're getting any comfort

609
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,000
if you're getting any comfort,

610
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,600
if you stand before Mount Sinai,

611
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,040
you and I,

612
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,800
and we say,

613
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,020
I'm trying to fulfill

614
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,800
what you ask.

615
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm trying to keep the law

616
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,800
of Mount Sinai.

617
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,500
It says perfection.

618
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,880
You've got to be perfect.

619
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,800
If you are not perfect,

620
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,260
you're guilty.

621
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,520
And because you were guilty,

622
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,160
you were damned.

623
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,580
Mount Sinai hands out

624
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,920
only eternal death

625
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,580
and damnation

626
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,300
for your body

627
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,160
and soul and mine.

628
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,720
That's all it can give.

629
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,020
Why?

630
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
There's no Christ there.

631
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,880
Don't you realize

632
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,200
there is no Christ

633
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,980
at Mount Sinai?

634
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,140
It was never intended to save.

635
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,320
But, oh God,

636
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,740
when we stand at Mount Sinai

637
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,420
and we realize

638
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,160
that we're condemned,

639
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,160
that there's no difference

640
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,680
that all of us have sinned,

641
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,300
and because eternal damnation

642
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,740
is on it,

643
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,920
we rush from Mount Sinai

644
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,080
and we go over to Mount Calvary

645
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,300
and lo and behold,

646
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,440
there's a Christ there

647
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,900
and there's a cross there

648
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,880
and we stand before the cross

649
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,420
and we say,

650
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,240
here is hope.

651
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
Here is the God-man

652
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,360
who came from heaven

653
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,540
and came to this earth

654
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
and on the cross

655
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,680
he took the guilt

656
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,340
and the punishment

657
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,920
of the world

658
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
and in that death

659
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,960
he bore the equal

660
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,680
of an eternity

661
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,100
in hell for the human race

662
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,320
and he stands there

663
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,660
and he said,

664
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,580
if you trust me

665
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,640
and put your faith

666
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,380
and your confidence

667
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,580
in me as your savior,

668
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,180
I will rescue you

669
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,800
from hell

670
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,240
and bestow upon you

671
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,260
the blessing of eternal life

672
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,840
and everlasting salvation.

673
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,780
Marvelous, isn't it?

674
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,820
You can stand there

675
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,760
at Mount Calvary.

676
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,320
Listen, there's a Christ there

677
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,680
and there's a cross

678
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,640
but there isn't here.

679
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,400
Oh, if I could write it

680
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,540
on your souls this morning

681
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,240
you'd remember

682
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,060
as long as you live

683
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,260
there never was,

684
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,060
there isn't now

685
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,980
and there never will be

686
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
a road leading to heaven

687
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,940
from Mount Sinai.

688
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,640
I don't care how sincere

689
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,360
you are, listen,

690
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,660
if we could rejoice

691
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,740
that we're Christians

692
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,380
and because we are Christians

693
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,200
that we are therefore

694
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,260
not sons of Mount Sinai,

695
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,780
we're not sons of Hegel,

696
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,860
we're not Ishmaelites,

697
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,160
we're not lost and damned,

698
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,100
we are sons of Sarah,

699
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,220
free and saved,

700
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,040
then if we could rejoice

701
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,180
in that fact,

702
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,760
then we would expect in life

703
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
that we are going

704
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,080
to be persecuted

705
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,280
and we're going

706
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,240
to have barbshot at us

707
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,340
when we try to tell people

708
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,120
who stand at Mount Sinai

709
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,820
there is no road

710
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,860
leading to heaven

711
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,600
from Mount Sinai.

712
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,180
Isn't it strange

713
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,300
the people that stand

714
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,160
at Mount Sinai

715
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,100
and get such a comfort

716
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,440
out of it,

717
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,000
they love it.

718
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Here's a mountain

719
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,780
that damns them

720
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,540
and they stand there.

721
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,540
Oh, how sweet you are.

722
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,780
I know I'm saved

723
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,800
because I'm so good

724
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,340
when Mount Sinai says

725
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,880
you're lost

726
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,800
and there's no road

727
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,920
leading to heaven

728
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,640
and yet some people

729
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,560
make themselves think

730
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:17,880
that there is.

731
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
And then you tell them

732
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
that there's no road

733
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
and what happens?

734
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,600
Same thing that happened

735
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,740
back in Abraham's home.

736
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,760
Why, listen,

737
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,380
just as soon as Hagar,

738
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,180
the slave woman,

739
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,960
knew that she was

740
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,780
going to have a child,

741
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,820
she from then on

742
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,480
started to thumb

743
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,320
her nose at Sarah.

744
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,760
Why, she simply

745
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,280
treated her with impudence.

746
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,700
Look who I am,

747
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,460
a slave woman.

748
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm going to have

749
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,500
the child, not you.

750
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
And then she had

751
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,980
Ishmael, the slave,

752
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,840
and then later on

753
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,960
Sarah had her son

754
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,340
and Isaac grew up

755
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,080
and let me tell you

756
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,200
Ishmael gave Isaac

757
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,180
a dog's life

758
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,600
and Hagar gave Sarah

759
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,380
a dog's life.

760
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
They were mean

761
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,100
and they got to the place

762
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,920
where life couldn't

763
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,500
go on anymore

764
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,260
and Abraham said,

765
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:54,840
Get out!

766
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,140
Get out, Hagar!

767
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,800
Get out, Ishmael!

768
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,620
You will not inherit

769
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,560
as my son.

770
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,040
Isn't it strange,

771
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,920
even as I talk now,

772
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
how many stand

773
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,680
at Mount Sinai

774
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,520
and say to those

775
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,800
who stand at Mount Calvary,

776
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,340
don't you dare tell me

777
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,320
that there's no road

778
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,940
leading to heaven?

779
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,900
How many stand

780
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,340
and say,

781
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,720
Listen,

782
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,440
you know anybody

783
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,860
that says,

784
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't belong to church

785
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,260
and I don't intend to?

786
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,240
You see,

787
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,140
not belong to church

788
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,700
means you don't need Christ.

789
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,340
You don't need Jesus

790
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,000
and the cross.

791
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,840
How many,

792
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,120
am I talking to somebody

793
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,420
that's more,

794
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,440
and you're already peed?

795
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
How many stand

796
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,860
at Mount Sinai

797
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,300
and say,

798
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,260
I don't belong

799
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,080
to your old church

800
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,020
and I don't think

801
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,540
I have to,

802
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,220
I'm just as good

803
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,180
as anybody that does?

804
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,440
Believe you me,

805
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,640
I can stand here

806
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
and I'll do the best

807
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,140
that I can.

808
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,180
How many of you say,

809
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,500
I belong to an organization

810
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,720
that's very religious

811
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,800
and I know that

812
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,620
if I do everything

813
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,420
that that organization

814
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,160
tells me,

815
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,560
I know that I'm going

816
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,480
to be saved.

817
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,300
Where you at, friend?

818
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,300
Aren't you at Mount Sinai?

819
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Aren't you saying,

820
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,620
if I can do

821
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,780
what I've been told to do

822
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,400
and obey it,

823
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,680
fine,

824
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,820
I'm going to be saved?

825
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,800
Are you,

826
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,440
listen,

827
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,840
may I remind you

828
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,400
from the depth

829
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,960
of my heart,

830
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,780
the crescent

831
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,400
is not the cross.

832
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,560
It is not the cross.

833
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,960
It never was.

834
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,880
It never will be.

835
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,560
You may say,

836
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm standing

837
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,120
and I'm doing

838
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,900
the best that I can.

839
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
I've got Christ.

840
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I follow him

841
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,220
as an example.

842
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,620
Listen, friend,

843
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,920
you may bring Christ

844
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,760
to Mount Sinai,

845
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,400
but you can never

846
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,140
bring the cross there

847
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,440
and Christ

848
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
without the cross

849
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
is only an example

850
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,300
and you can't

851
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,940
follow him.

852
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,780
Believe me,

853
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,340
to be saved

854
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,220
following Christ

855
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,800
is an example.

856
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,940
You've got to be perfect

857
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,980
and you can't be.

858
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,480
Oh, my words

859
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,020
may hurt you

860
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,580
this morning,

861
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
but oh, listen,

862
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,380
I don't want

863
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,500
your blood on my soul.

864
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,020
I don't want

865
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,460
some of you

866
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,620
to say,

867
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,440
I don't need the church

868
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,540
and I don't need Christ.

869
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm going to stand

870
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,560
at Mount Sinai

871
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,160
and I've got

872
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,300
such a good life

873
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,700
and I'm going to stand

874
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,660
and I'm going to heaven

875
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,740
because believe me,

876
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,560
as God lives,

877
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,420
there's no road

878
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,880
to heaven

879
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,720
from Mount Sinai.

880
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,700
And I believe me.

881
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,260
If you're going to

882
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,920
stand there,

883
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,860
listen, friend,

884
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,920
for goodness sakes,

885
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,980
ask yourself,

886
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,200
do you have

887
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,660
the Christ of the cross

888
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,340
at the center

889
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,000
of your religion?

890
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,320
Do you know

891
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,200
what I'm talking about?

892
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,320
If you're at

893
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
Mount Sinai,

894
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:15,720
listen,

895
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,900
there isn't any road

896
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,300
to heaven,

897
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,180
there never was

898
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,860
and never will be.

899
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,080
You're on the wrong track.

900
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,020
It can't be.

901
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,040
Oh, you may be hurt,

902
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,500
but I'd rather

903
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,280
have you hurt

904
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,220
and examine it

905
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,080
and be saved

906
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,400
than to go out

907
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,720
of church

908
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,780
not being hurt

909
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,660
and standing

910
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,920
at Mount Sinai

911
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,600
and saying,

912
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,340
I thumb my nose

913
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,020
at the Christians

914
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,680
in the church.

915
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,420
I'm going this way.

916
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,840
Don't go this way.

917
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,640
It isn't a way.

918
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,020
Could I make it any clearer?

919
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,520
And listen,

920
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,140
when you can stand here,

921
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,620
remember,

922
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,600
we ought to thank God

923
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,320
that there is

924
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,060
a Calvary,

925
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,780
that there's a Christ

926
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,680
in the cross.

927
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,460
There is no Christ

928
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,720
and no cross

929
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,080
at Mount Sinai.

930
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,920
Will you believe me?

931
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,600
Oh, listen,

932
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,760
no wonder Paul says,

933
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,000
rejoice as Christians.

934
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Rejoice that you're not

935
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,140
sons of Mount Sinai

936
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,040
lost and damned.

937
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,520
You're sons of Mount Calvary.

938
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:05,980
You're free

939
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,640
and you're saved.

940
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,000
And you and I may say,

941
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,680
well, it's so hard

942
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,120
to believe

943
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
that sons of Sinai

944
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,460
are lost.

945
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,380
I know it is

946
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,100
because people are sincere

947
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,400
and you want to do your best.

948
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,100
But listen,

949
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,380
it's just like this

950
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,360
and just that simple.

951
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,140
There's no road

952
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,580
to heaven

953
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,380
from Mount Sinai.

954
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,280
How in the world

955
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,080
can you be saved

956
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,820
by doing your best

957
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,220
when there's no road going?

958
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,860
There just isn't

959
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,080
because there's no Christ

960
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,980
and there's no cross.

961
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,160
And bear this in mind,

962
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,880
Mount Sinai

963
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
has no one to give us

964
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,620
who gives us power

965
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,400
to live a life

966
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,000
that is pleasing

967
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,900
in the sight of God.

968
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,080
Oh, you may say,

969
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
my life is pleasing

970
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,040
in the sight of God

971
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,420
when I stand at Mount Sinai.

972
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Is it?

973
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,140
The word of God,

974
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,900
my Bible says,

975
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,640
without faith

976
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,400
it is impossible

977
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,320
to please God.

978
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,440
A man without Christ,

979
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,700
his life doesn't please.

980
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,360
Listen, fam,

981
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,140
this hurts.

982
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,160
You can give everything

983
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,180
you've got to the poor.

984
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,120
You can go out

985
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,140
and dedicate your life

986
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,860
to the help

987
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
of all human beings.

988
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,280
But listen,

989
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,380
if you're standing

990
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,340
at Mount Sinai

991
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,300
and there's no Christ

992
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,420
in your heart by faith,

993
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,340
your whole life

994
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,360
means nothing to God.

995
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,560
God will say,

996
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,200
depart from me,

997
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,140
I never knew you.

998
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,140
You can stand and say,

999
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,480
well, Lord,

1000
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,440
don't you know me?

1001
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,520
Well, I gave everything

1002
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,500
I had to the poor.

1003
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,560
I simply healed the sick

1004
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,920
and I cast out devils

1005
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,780
and I did wonderful things.

1006
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,280
And Jesus will say,

1007
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,660
depart,

1008
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,620
I never knew you.

1009
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,780
Oh, there's no power,

1010
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,180
you see.

1011
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,060
How in the world

1012
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,960
could your life and mine

1013
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,980
be pleasing to God

1014
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,840
when we stand

1015
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,480
at Mount Sinai

1016
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,180
and we're staying

1017
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,600
under condemnation

1018
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,680
and we're damned to hell.

1019
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
A damned soul

1020
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,980
can't please God.

1021
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,180
Is it clear?

1022
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,660
Or am I talking

1023
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,220
over your heads

1024
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,740
this morning?

1025
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,220
When you go

1026
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,080
to Mount Calvary,

1027
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
you and I stand there,

1028
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,860
oh, listen,

1029
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,200
we stand there

1030
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,780
knowing that we're

1031
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,280
not perfect.

1032
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,000
We stand there

1033
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,440
with guilt.

1034
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,160
We stand there

1035
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,040
knowing we're condemned.

1036
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
But there's the Christ

1037
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,360
and the cross

1038
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,780
and when we forsake all

1039
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,680
and we take him,

1040
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,160
when we put our trust

1041
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,940
into our confidence

1042
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,260
and say,

1043
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,360
you died for me,

1044
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,560
I want you,

1045
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,120
the Christ who died,

1046
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,340
he comes and lives

1047
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,180
within you and me

1048
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,520
and oh,

1049
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,240
what a difference.

1050
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,800
Then when he lives

1051
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,320
within us,

1052
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
he gives us power

1053
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,060
so that our imperfect lives

1054
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,940
do please God.

1055
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,060
When we fail

1056
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,720
and come short,

1057
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,620
his righteousness

1058
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,400
covers up our imperfections

1059
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
so that our lives

1060
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,160
do look pleasing

1061
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,100
in the sight of God

1062
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,580
even though they fail

1063
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,600
and they come short

1064
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,900
in so many things.

1065
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,620
But you see,

1066
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,920
the righteousness of Jesus

1067
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
makes your life

1068
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,720
and mind acceptable

1069
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,860
and when he lives

1070
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,380
in your heart

1071
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,120
and mind by faith

1072
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,900
he gives us power

1073
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,240
that when temptations come

1074
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,320
we can say no

1075
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,080
and we can walk

1076
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,500
in ways pleasing with him

1077
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,420
and you and I

1078
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,220
can find joy

1079
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,240
in doing his will

1080
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,660
to the best of our ability

1081
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,400
but knowing

1082
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
that it doesn't save,

1083
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,100
knowing that his blood

1084
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,880
and his righteousness

1085
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
alone save.

1086
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,080
Oh,

1087
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,820
we ought to be able

1088
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,480
to thank God.

1089
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:37,740
Listen,

1090
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,220
will you just remember this?

1091
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,600
When you stand

1092
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,720
at Mount Sinai

1093
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,840
and oh,

1094
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,460
there's something,

1095
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:43,660
oh,

1096
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,260
I know we like

1097
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,720
to achieve our own salvation

1098
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,660
if I'm going to be saved

1099
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,540
I'm going to do it myself

1100
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
but remember

1101
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,740
from Mount Sinai

1102
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,420
in Arabia

1103
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,960
only slaves,

1104
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,620
there's no road,

1105
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,440
never was a road

1106
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,000
going to heaven

1107
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,100
but from Mount Calvary

1108
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,420
a wonderful way

1109
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,780
we ought to thank God today

1110
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,020
that as Christians

1111
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,900
we are not

1112
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,660
sons of Sinai,

1113
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,580
we are not

1114
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,060
lost and damned creatures

1115
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,380
but we are free

1116
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,480
sons and daughters

1117
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,600
of again

1118
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,780
of Mount Calvary

1119
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,440
because there's

1120
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
the Christ and the cross.

1121
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,700
We ought to thank God

1122
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,020
that listen,

1123
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,680
this covenant

1124
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,380
that God made

1125
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,000
at Mount Sinai,

1126
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,200
how in the world

1127
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,940
could it ever

1128
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,020
in any way

1129
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,300
repudiate the covenant

1130
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,040
that God made

1131
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,520
at Calvary.

1132
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,100
You may say,

1133
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,240
well,

1134
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,460
didn't Sinai come first?

1135
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,260
Oh, no.

1136
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,700
Mount Sinai came

1137
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,220
430 years after

1138
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,500
God made it for Calvary.

1139
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,520
You may say,

1140
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,440
how is that?

1141
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,500
Mount Sinai,

1142
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,480
1500 years before Christ

1143
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,140
in Calvary A.D. 33

1144
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,380
but listen,

1145
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,680
God made this covenant

1146
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,480
with Abraham

1147
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,160
2,000 years before

1148
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,260
and with Adam

1149
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,040
4,000 years B.C.

1150
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,520
but it was fulfilled

1151
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
of Calvary

1152
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
that Christ

1153
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
was going to come.

1154
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,600
He was the Lamb

1155
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,820
slain from the foundations

1156
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,420
of the world

1157
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,220
and listen,

1158
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,260
because the great covenant

1159
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,500
was made with Abraham

1160
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,580
and Mount Sinai

1161
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,320
came 430 years later.

1162
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,920
Mount Sinai

1163
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,780
could never repudiate

1164
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Calvary

1165
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,500
or repudiate

1166
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,980
the covenant

1167
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,600
that God made

1168
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,160
with Abraham

1169
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,960
and what a joy then

1170
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,780
as again,

1171
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,780
Paul reminded them,

1172
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,020
he says,

1173
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,460
remember

1174
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,200
that the children

1175
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
of the childless mother

1176
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,760
of the barren mother

1177
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
shall be greater

1178
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
than the children

1179
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,140
of the one

1180
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,880
that has a husband.

1181
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Isn't that true?

1182
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,040
Look at the Christian church.

1183
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,880
Look at the sons of Sarah.

1184
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,160
Sarah was barren,

1185
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,100
oh yes,

1186
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,520
and only produced one son,

1187
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,280
but look at the Christian church,

1188
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,200
those who stand

1189
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,160
at Mount Calvary.

1190
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,080
Oh,

1191
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,280
when you count the numbers,

1192
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,740
how much greater they are

1193
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,240
than the sons of Hagar,

1194
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
than the Jewish people

1195
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,820
today in the Ishmaelites

1196
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,400
who do not stand

1197
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,660
at Mount Calvary.

1198
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,220
The Christian church

1199
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,000
is immense.

1200
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,360
It stands so marvelously great.

1201
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
Sons and daughters

1202
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,560
of Sarah

1203
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,580
free

1204
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,960
because there's a road

1205
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,380
to heaven

1206
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,840
that leads

1207
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,980
from Mount Calvary

1208
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,080
that leads

1209
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,680
into heaven.

1210
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,660
But you know,

1211
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,700
there's a marvelous miracle

1212
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,460
that can happen.

1213
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,800
You may be standing today

1214
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,100
and say,

1215
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,040
I've been at Mount Sinai

1216
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,640
all my life.

1217
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,080
I've never understood

1218
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,940
Mount Calvary.

1219
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,100
I realize

1220
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,040
that there isn't a road

1221
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,660
going to heaven

1222
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,640
from Mount Sinai.

1223
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,820
But you know,

1224
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,100
Ishmael had to be Ishmael.

1225
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,420
But oh,

1226
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,980
you and I,

1227
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,760
if we're Ishmaelites,

1228
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,760
we can be Isaacites.

1229
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,580
By the grace of God,

1230
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,860
we can walk over to Calvary

1231
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,000
and we can say,

1232
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,220
God,

1233
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,820
I'm done with Mount Sinai

1234
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,680
as the way to heaven.

1235
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,640
I know that there's

1236
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,620
no road leading there,

1237
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,800
but I come to Calvary

1238
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,920
and we can come

1239
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,740
with all of our sins

1240
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,440
and we can look up

1241
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,140
at Christ and say,

1242
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,460
Lord,

1243
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,660
I put my trust in you

1244
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,080
and we can stand

1245
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,120
as free men and women.

1246
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,560
You can go out

1247
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
of church this morning

1248
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,040
and you can say,

1249
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,480
I'm on the road

1250
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,000
to heaven.

1251
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,420
I am saved

1252
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,000
because Sinai

1253
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,900
has condemned me.

1254
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,540
There's no road,

1255
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,740
but there is one road

1256
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,300
and I'm on that road

1257
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,380
in Jesus Christ.

1258
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,460
Jesus said,

1259
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,900
I am the way,

1260
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,680
the truth,

1261
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,200
and the life.

1262
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Why not let Jesus

1263
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,660
save you and me?

1264
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,240
Why can't we go on

1265
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,960
the glory road

1266
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
and sing with joy,

1267
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,840
My hope is built

1268
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,180
on nothing less

1269
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,020
than Jesus' blood

1270
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,000
and righteousness.

1271
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,260
No merit of my own,

1272
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,040
I claim,

1273
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,120
but wholly lean

1274
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,620
on Jesus' name.

1275
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,220
On Christ,

1276
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,340
the solid rock,

1277
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,280
I stand.

1278
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,900
All other ground

1279
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,260
is sinking sand.

1280
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,680
Could I write it

1281
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,820
on your soul once more?

1282
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,980
There is no road

1283
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,300
that leads to heaven

1284
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,260
from Mount Sinai.

1285
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,480
There is one road

1286
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,420
that leads to heaven.

1287
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,460
Thank God there is

1288
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,240
one road,

1289
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,700
but it leads

1290
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,420
from Mount Calvary.

1291
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,320
God grant you

1292
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,520
and me as Christians

1293
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,980
to stand before

1294
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,380
Mount Calvary

1295
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,180
and thank God

1296
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,140
for a Christ

1297
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,020
and above all

1298
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,880
for a Christ

1299
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,380
with a cross.

1300
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,780
Amen.

1301
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,800
The peace of God

1302
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,560
which passeth

1303
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,920
all human understanding,

1304
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,120
keep and unite

1305
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,180
your hearts and minds

1306
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
in Christ Jesus

1307
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,940
unto life everlasting.

1308
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,340
Amen.
