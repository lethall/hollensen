1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
The peace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:19,700
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written back in the Old Testament, in the book of Judges, the 16th chapter, the 20th verse.

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,220
And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.

4
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:39,020
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

5
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:51,820
Good morning, dear friends in Christ Jesus, you who are here in church, and you also who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:04,060
It is nice having you in church this morning, friends, and it is nice also to have you who are in the radio audience worshiping with us.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,140
That text that I just read has to do with a man by the name of Samson.

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,500
And I'm sure that when I mention his name, Samson, that all of you say, yes, I know that man.

9
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,700
Samson, that's the strong man of the Old Testament, the man that had superhuman strength, and you are right.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,920
That's the man we're going to talk about this morning.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,260
This man, Samson, was known as a judge in Israel, or a deliverer.

12
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,840
God had appointed him to deliver Israel from the hands of the enemy, the Philistines.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,800
This man, Samson, however, was a very peculiar man.

14
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,680
There lived amongst the Philistines a very wicked woman by the name of Delilah.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,900
She flirted with Samson, and Samson flirted with her, and then Samson went to sin with her.

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,080
Now, he went to sin with Delilah for only one reason, and that was that he wanted to.

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,740
He deliberately wanted to go and sin with her, and that's what he did.

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:16,220
She, however, had been told by her own Philistine people that she was to find out the secret of this man's strength

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,900
so that they could overcome him and kill him, and thus overcome Israel.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,500
She questioned him at length, and he lied to her, which he knew was wrong, but he did it anyway.

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,780
Then, finally, in a weaker moment, when she asked him again,

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,280
Wherein lies your strength, Samson?

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Then he told her, he said, Before I was born, my parents dedicated me to the Lord.

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,800
I am a Nazirite. I have taken the Nazirite vow.

25
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,720
He said, No razor has ever touched my head.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
My strength, therefore, is evident in my hair.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,600
And so, when he was fast asleep, she had the Philistines come,

28
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,860
and they cut off the hair of Samson.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,200
And then Samson awoke, and we read this tragic statement about him,

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,560
And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,700
Samson got up, and God had departed from him,

32
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,360
And the man didn't even know it.

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,280
What a tragedy.

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,120
God had abandoned Samson.

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,400
And there wasn't one inkling of awareness.

36
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,060
He wasn't conscious of it.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,000
He didn't know it.

38
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,740
He was not cognizant of it.

39
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:47,120
But God was gone, and Samson didn't know it.

40
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,860
If we translate this into the New Testament,

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,720
God speaks to you and me this morning with regard to Samson.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,660
And in New Testament terminology,

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
God says to you and me this morning,

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,240
The same thing that happened to Samson,

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
that God departed from him,

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,260
and he didn't even know it is exactly the same thing that can happen to you,

47
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,740
and it can happen to me.

48
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,200
You and I can lose Christ.

49
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,560
We can lose him and everything that we have in him.

50
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,680
The forgiveness of our sins,

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Deliverance from hell and damnation,

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,340
And the gift of eternal life.

53
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,560
Mind you, friends,

54
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,160
You and I can lose Christ,

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,860
And not even be aware of it.

56
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,560
Not even have an inkling.

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,580
You and I can lose him and be the last man on earth to know

58
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,040
That we've lost him.

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,000
It is something that can happen to you and to me and to any Christian.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,940
You and I may say,

61
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Do you mean to say that I can lose Christ and not even know it?

62
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,960
That I can lose him unawares?

63
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,520
That I won't even have the least inkling that he's gone out of my heart and my life?

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,240
Do you mean to tell me that I can be a living, condemned person?

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,700
That I can be the last one to know it?

66
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,500
And that I can feel that I still have him, but that I may not?

67
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you mean to tell me that I can lose Christ and not know it?

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes.

69
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,700
Samson didn't know it, and God had forsaken him.

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,100
We may say that's impossible, but it isn't.

71
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,800
It is very possible because this thing can happen to you and me

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,080
for the same reason that it happened to Samson.

73
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,180
And we may say,

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Why did it happen to Samson?

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,760
This is it.

76
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,140
Because Samson deliberately sinned.

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,640
Samson did that which he knew was wrong.

78
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,300
And therefore, you and I can lose Christ

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,520
and not have the least bit of inkling

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,780
the very demon that has gone out of our lives forever

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,380
and the thing that can do it.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
The very demon that can do it

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,980
is that which we call deliberate, willful sin.

84
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
You and I may say,

85
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,720
Can deliberate, willful sin

86
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,080
cause me to lose Christ and everything that he's given me

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,540
and cause me not even to be aware of it,

88
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,260
not even to know it,

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,520
to be perfectly oblivious to it,

90
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,240
to be the last man in the world,

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,840
and to go on living in a fool's paradise

92
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,180
thinking I've got Christ when I don't have...

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,660
Yes.

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,380
Deliberate sin is the culprit that can do it.

95
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,560
And it can do it because,

96
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,420
in the first place, let's know this,

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,620
deliberate sin has a way of blinding you and me

98
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,140
to what we know,

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,760
and that is that deliberate sin

100
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,880
is very, very sinful.

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,440
You and I as Christians,

102
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,580
we're going to look at this thing

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,860
that we call deliberate sin this morning.

104
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,200
We're not talking about sins

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,100
that you and I commit every day,

106
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,520
sins of weakness where we don't give our consent to them.

107
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,400
We're not talking about the things

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,100
which we want to do but we don't,

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,220
and the things which we have left undone,

110
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,360
the things which we have done,

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
which we, again, did not will to do.

112
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,180
By deliberate sin, this is what we mean.

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,660
Deliberate sin is that sin

114
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,100
which you and I do because we want to do it.

115
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,220
Deliberate sin is that sin

116
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,820
that you and I don't have to do.

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,420
We know it's wrong before we do it,

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,520
but we choose to do it.

119
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,060
We say,

120
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,860
I do it because I want to do it.

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,880
And we say to ourselves,

122
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,080
you know how sinful,

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,440
how wicked that is.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
When God says,

125
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,980
I am the Almighty God,

126
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
thou shalt have no other gods before me.

127
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,560
Deliberate sin says,

128
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,460
says you, God,

129
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
you mean to tell me

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,900
that I'm going to do your will all the time?

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,180
I am not going to do your will.

132
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm going to do what I want to do.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,980
And you make something of it.

134
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,960
God says,

135
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
thou shalt not take the name of the Lord,

136
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,660
thy God, in vain.

137
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,200
Deliberate sin says,

138
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,720
oh yeah,

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,580
I'll take your name in vain

140
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,820
any time I want to.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,480
And when I choose to do it,

142
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,420
I know it's wrong,

143
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
but I'm going to do it anyhow.

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,100
And you make the most of it.

145
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,980
That's deliberate sin.

146
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,260
Deliberate sin means when God says,

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,380
remember the Sabbath day

148
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,200
to keep it hold of you.

149
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,660
And I say,

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,520
says you, God,

151
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll go to church

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
when I want to go to church.

153
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,560
And when I don't want to go to church,

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll not go to church.

155
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,800
And what are you going to do about it?

156
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,440
I will do what I choose to do,

157
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,240
what I like to do,

158
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,620
and you can do what you want to do.

159
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,640
God says,

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,800
thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother,

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
and you and I can say,

162
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,560
honor my father, mother,

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,800
I should say not.

164
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,600
I will not obey them.

165
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,720
I don't choose to obey them.

166
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,260
I know that I should,

167
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,420
but I'm not going to do it.

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,840
That's deliberate,

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
willful sin.

170
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,540
It means we know it's wrong,

171
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,840
but we do it for only one reason,

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,500
because we want to do it.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
And that's why Samson did

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,620
what he wanted to do,

175
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,560
because he wanted to do it.

176
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,020
And when God says,

177
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
thou shalt not kill,

178
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,640
you and I may translate it into hate,

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,940
and say,

180
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,580
I'll hate who I want to hate,

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
and I'll keep on hating them.

182
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,160
I'll hate them because I want to hate them.

183
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,380
And you, God,

184
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
do something about it.

185
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,720
And God says,

186
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,640
thou shalt not commit adultery,

187
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
and you and I can say,

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,580
I live only once,

189
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,620
and I'm going to live just as immoral

190
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,740
as I want to live,

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,420
and as I choose to live,

192
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,480
and I'm going to do it

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,840
because I want to do it.

194
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,580
And God,

195
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,940
you try to stop me.

196
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,200
Thou shalt not steal.

197
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,860
I'll be just as dishonest

198
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,920
as I want to be.

199
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,840
My business is going to thrive,

200
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,780
and what do I care

201
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,040
whether I'm honest or not?

202
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,220
I choose to be dishonest,

203
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,740
and God,

204
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,200
you make the most of it.

205
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,680
God says,

206
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,240
thou shalt not bear false witness

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,000
against the neighbor,

208
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,300
and I'll lie about my neighbor

209
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,540
when I want to lie about him,

210
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
and I'll not speak the truth

211
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
in love about him.

212
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
I'll do as I plead.

213
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
And when God says,

214
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,360
thou shalt not covet

215
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,140
at the neighbor's house

216
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,800
or his wife

217
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,580
or his manservant

218
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,280
or his maidservant,

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,380
you and I say,

220
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,120
I'll covet whom I want to covet

221
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
and what I want.

222
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,480
I'll be just as greedy

223
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,140
and jealous

224
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,460
and hatred and avaricious

225
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,480
as I want to be,

226
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,180
and I'll choose to do that,

227
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,620
and God,

228
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,720
you make the most of it.

229
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,940
That's what I'm talking about

230
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,500
this morning.

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
I'm talking about

232
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,300
deliberate sin.

233
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,560
You and I know

234
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,160
how wicked it is.

235
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,460
Why?

236
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
Whenever in your life

237
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,820
and mine,

238
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,820
you and I do that

239
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,940
which we know is wrong,

240
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,420
whenever you and I say,

241
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,220
I do it because

242
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,060
I want to do it,

243
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,080
I don't have to do it,

244
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
but I choose to do it,

245
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,120
in that moment

246
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
we dethrone Christ.

247
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,320
We tell Christ,

248
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,560
Christ,

249
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,720
you're no longer my master,

250
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,400
you're no longer

251
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
the Lord of my life,

252
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,740
I am the master,

253
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
get out of here!

254
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,300
You know that

255
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,980
as well as I.

256
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,740
But you know,

257
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,660
it's a strange thing

258
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,580
whenever we embark

259
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,060
on a life of delivered sin,

260
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,140
whenever we say,

261
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,820
I know it's wrong,

262
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,820
but I'm going to do it anyhow,

263
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,420
that sort of blinds

264
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,660
you and me.

265
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,880
It blinds us

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,840
to the maliciousness

267
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,920
of this delivered

268
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,640
kind of sin,

269
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,500
and it makes us feel

270
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,080
that it's not too evil,

271
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,580
that Christ doesn't go out

272
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,320
of our hearts

273
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,180
somehow or other,

274
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,780
and therefore again,

275
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,780
this is a possibility,

276
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,020
and this can happen

277
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,700
to you and me,

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,780
that we can lose Christ

279
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
and lose everything

280
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,780
that he has given us,

281
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
and not even know it

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
and live in a fool's paradise,

283
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,960
because deliberate sin,

284
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,740
when it blinds us

285
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,760
to its evil,

286
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,980
it takes Christ

287
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,000
out of our hearts

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,640
and it blinds us

289
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
so that we aren't

290
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,400
even aware

291
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,460
that he's gone,

292
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
then it deceives us

293
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,380
and tells us,

294
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
oh, he's still there,

295
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,920
you're an important person,

296
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,780
you're an exception,

297
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
Christ wouldn't ever

298
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
leave you,

299
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,440
and we say,

300
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,380
oh, I still have Christ,

301
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,740
I can go out

302
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,940
and live in deliberate sin,

303
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
I can do as I please,

304
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
he hasn't left me,

305
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,620
I'm not aware

306
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
that he's gone,

307
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
therefore I still have him,

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,680
everything's all right,

309
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,660
he is my Lord,

310
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,200
oh yes,

311
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,840
that's what Samson thought,

312
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,520
but he wist not,

313
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,300
he didn't know

314
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,160
that God had departed

315
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
from him

316
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,820
and had abandoned him,

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
oh, if we could just

318
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,520
write this on our hearts

319
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:22,980
this morning,

320
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,240
it can happen to you

321
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,300
and it can happen to me,

322
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,020
I don't care who you are,

323
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,040
who I am,

324
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,420
this can happen,

325
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,320
it's a possibility

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,180
that can come into

327
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,080
your life and mine,

328
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,080
that you and I

329
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,980
can lose Christ

330
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,240
as our Lord and Savior,

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,200
lose every blessing

332
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,220
that we have in him

333
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,340
and not even be aware of it,

334
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
just not have

335
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,300
the faintest,

336
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,360
slightest idea

337
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
that he's gone

338
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,540
and live in a fool's paradise

339
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,020
and not have him,

340
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,700
and when we admit

341
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,360
that this thing

342
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,460
can happen to us,

343
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,000
then ought not this

344
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,740
be the time

345
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,980
to stop and to say,

346
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,720
what about this thing

347
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,180
of deliberate sin,

348
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
oh, you and I

349
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,740
sin every day,

350
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,700
not deliberately,

351
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,220
again, we sin in weakness,

352
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,520
we don't give our consent

353
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,480
to so many things

354
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,980
that we do

355
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,560
that are wrong,

356
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,060
but is there anything

357
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,160
in your life

358
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,660
and mine

359
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,600
that we do

360
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
because we choose

361
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,340
to do it

362
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,700
and we know

363
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,620
that it's wrong,

364
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,820
let's look at it,

365
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,140
how about it,

366
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,340
taking God's name

367
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,800
in vain,

368
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
how many of us

369
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,100
take his name

370
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,980
in profanity,

371
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,020
in dirtiness,

372
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,100
and we simply

373
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,880
besmirch God's name,

374
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,300
how many of us

375
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,600
do it

376
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
because we want

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
to do it,

378
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
how many of us

379
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:34,800
say,

380
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,220
I don't go to church

381
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,520
and I don't intend

382
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,020
to go to church,

383
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,120
is that in your life

384
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,700
and mine,

385
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,400
how many of us

386
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,660
say to ourselves,

387
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,180
honor my parents,

388
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,540
no,

389
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,500
how many of us

390
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,900
hate,

391
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,180
how many of us

392
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,620
this morning

393
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,340
have got hatred

394
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,060
into our heart

395
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,080
and we feel

396
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,780
exceptional,

397
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,700
we're a different

398
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,180
person,

399
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,400
God says

400
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,000
he makes an

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,480
exception

402
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,360
and therefore

403
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,160
Christ still

404
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,680
lives in our,

405
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,560
may I tell you

406
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,320
he does not,

407
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,140
if there's hatred

408
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,860
in your heart

409
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,300
and mind

410
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,820
this morning

411
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,000
against anybody,

412
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,460
let me tell you

413
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,980
as sure as

414
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,960
God lives,

415
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,160
Christ is out

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,000
of your life,

417
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,360
he's gone,

418
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,220
you're living

419
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,280
death and

420
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,060
damnation

421
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,500
even though

422
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,040
you don't know

423
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,020
that's for you

424
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,620
and for me,

425
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,500
we're living

426
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,120
in immorality,

427
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,640
I don't care

428
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,500
who you are,

429
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,200
we're doing it

430
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,060
because we want

431
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,580
to do it

432
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,860
and if we're

433
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,300
doing it

434
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,920
because we

435
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,900
want to do it,

436
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,260
may I say

437
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,320
we're blinded,

438
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,740
we're blinded,

439
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,780
Christ is long

440
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,320
gone,

441
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,060
you and I

442
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,660
can say not

443
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,360
only can it

444
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,620
happen,

445
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,600
it has happened,

446
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,220
it happened

447
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
to Samson,

448
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,660
it happened

449
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,580
to Samson

450
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,360
with Delilah,

451
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,020
that man

452
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,160
lived again

453
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,060
as a slave

454
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,940
to his passion

455
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,880
and to his lust,

456
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,500
he lived for

457
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,780
sexual immorality,

458
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,600
this man

459
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,460
Samson,

460
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,980
when again

461
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,560
he gave in

462
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,200
to Delilah,

463
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,000
he wished

464
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,580
not

465
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,260
that the Lord

466
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,140
had departed

467
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,360
from him,

468
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,240
if there is

469
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,120
deliberate sin

470
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,820
in your life

471
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,280
and mine

472
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,000
this morning,

473
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,780
let's not

474
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,860
pull any punches,

475
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,580
Christ is gone,

476
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,280
you and I

477
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,900
can shout

478
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,440
to the heavens,

479
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,520
oh he's in me,

480
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,160
I know,

481
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,160
I pray

482
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,820
and I go to

483
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,220
church

484
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,720
and I get

485
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,120
money,

486
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,620
yeah,

487
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,680
but it's

488
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,600
blinded you

489
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,020
and me,

490
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,200
he is not

491
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
in your heart

492
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,940
and mine

493
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,740
when there is

494
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,980
deliberate sin,

495
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,100
believe me,

496
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,720
that's the word

497
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,420
of God,

498
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,720
oh Samson,

499
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,180
we say to ourselves,

500
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,780
God says,

501
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
what happened to him

502
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,260
can happen to you

503
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,620
and me,

504
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,100
can it?

505
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,880
yes,

506
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,240
the,

507
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,720
again,

508
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,480
the little

509
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,220
trickster,

510
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,140
the one

511
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,680
that plays

512
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,120
the trick

513
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,900
is this thing

514
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,480
that we call

515
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,340
deliberate sin

516
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,680
and that deliberate

517
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,620
sin means this

518
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,120
that I know

519
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,520
it's wrong

520
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,240
but I do it

521
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,320
because I want

522
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,740
to do it,

523
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,320
because I get

524
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
pleasure out of it,

525
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,700
because it satisfies me

526
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,980
and bear in mind

527
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,820
that this thing

528
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,360
that we call

529
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
deliberate sin,

530
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
it can cause us

531
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,040
to lose Christ

532
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,860
and not have

533
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,980
the faintest idea

534
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,560
that he's ever

535
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,080
left us

536
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,620
to revel in the idea

537
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,720
and say to ourselves,

538
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,000
oh he still lives

539
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,480
in me

540
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,400
and he's gone

541
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,540
and not have

542
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
the slightest inkling,

543
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,240
not even feel

544
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,160
again that he's

545
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,240
ever left us,

546
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,540
you and I

547
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,040
can be living

548
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,200
in a fool's paradise,

549
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,080
the last one

550
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,420
in the world

551
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,840
to know it,

552
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,140
why?

553
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Because in the second

554
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,680
place let's know

555
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,420
this thing called

556
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,360
deliberate sin,

557
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,960
this thing has a way

558
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,660
of blinding you

559
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,240
and me to something

560
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,740
else we know,

561
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,960
the damnable-ness

562
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,560
of deliberate sin,

563
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,620
how damnable

564
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,260
is

565
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,800
deliberate sin,

566
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,680
how damnable

567
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,800
in the sight of God

568
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,140
is it when you

569
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,420
and I deliberately,

570
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,540
willfully do that

571
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,280
which we know

572
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,800
is wrong

573
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,840
just because we

574
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,600
want to,

575
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,080
just because we

576
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,880
choose to,

577
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,920
well it's so

578
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,060
damnable that it

579
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,200
meant that God's

580
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,020
only son had to

581
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,580
come out of the

582
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,400
ivory palaces

583
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,340
into this world,

584
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,060
he had to become

585
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,780
a human being

586
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,500
without sin,

587
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,620
and he had to go

588
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,400
to the cross of

589
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,940
Calvary,

590
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,920
and he had to

591
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,640
take the guilt

592
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,480
of our deliberate

593
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,380
sin and its

594
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,820
punishment,

595
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,980
and he had to

596
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,660
bear hell

597
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,740
and damnation

598
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,680
for that sin

599
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,900
of deliberate

600
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,800
willfulness,

601
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,940
he had to die

602
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,160
for you and me

603
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,280
and bear hell,

604
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,160
the damnable-ness

605
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,060
of that sin

606
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,020
for you and me,

607
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,920
we had to be

608
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,840
died for,

609
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,200
now you and I

610
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,860
know that,

611
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,960
that it's damnable

612
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,920
to say to God,

613
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,740
I don't care,

614
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm going to do it,

615
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,500
I know it's wrong,

616
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,220
but I'm going to do it

617
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,520
anyhow,

618
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,840
what happens

619
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,640
when we do it,

620
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,500
you and I know,

621
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,940
the moment in your

622
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,600
life and mine

623
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
when we do that

624
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,940
which we know

625
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,360
is wrong,

626
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,500
we take back

627
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,380
from Christ

628
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,080
the guilt and

629
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,560
the punishment

630
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,180
that he bore

631
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,720
for us,

632
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,920
and we put it

633
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,620
back onto

634
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,300
ourselves,

635
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,960
we say to Christ,

636
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,440
let me have it,

637
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,680
and we put it

638
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
onto ourselves,

639
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,620
and when you and

640
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,080
I take from

641
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,620
Christ the guilt

642
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,360
and the punishment

643
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,580
that he bore for us,

644
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,760
and put it back

645
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,620
onto ourselves,

646
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,800
he can't stay

647
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,540
in your heart

648
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,180
in mine,

649
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,100
that kind of

650
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,260
rebellion he can't

651
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,820
stand,

652
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,600
then he says,

653
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,360
you don't want me

654
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,860
anymore,

655
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,760
when you no longer

656
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,640
let me be your

657
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,000
savior,

658
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,720
and you take it

659
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,420
back on yourself,

660
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,560
I must abandon

661
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:11,940
you,

662
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
I must leave,

663
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,280
and this deliberate

664
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,580
sin,

665
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,460
it blinds,

666
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,760
you see,

667
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,980
it blinds because

668
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,000
it offers so much

669
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,940
joy and satisfaction

670
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,540
for us,

671
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,080
that it blinds us

672
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
to everything else,

673
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
and it blinds us

674
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,560
to this damnableness,

675
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,140
and so,

676
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,800
deliberate sin,

677
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,260
it takes Christ

678
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,340
out of our hearts,

679
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,400
and it blinds us

680
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,000
to the fact

681
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that he's gone,

682
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,460
and then it

683
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,500
deceives us

684
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,180
into saying,

685
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,620
you're alright buddy,

686
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,800
just as long as

687
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,780
you use the magic

688
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,180
words,

689
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm sorry,

690
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,020
every day,

691
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
he'll never leave you,

692
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,400
he'll always be with you,

693
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,660
oh you know

694
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,420
it's strange,

695
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
individuals who

696
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,140
live in deliberate

697
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,640
sin,

698
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,180
how many have said,

699
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,700
oh I ask for

700
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,060
forgiveness,

701
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,720
I tell him I'm

702
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,460
sorry every day,

703
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,520
I even cry about it,

704
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,780
I cry at night,

705
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,640
and I tell him

706
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm so sorry

707
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,480
for the things

708
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,300
that I've done wrong

709
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,280
that I know are wrong,

710
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,540
and again,

711
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:02,940
you say,

712
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,560
well therefore

713
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,940
I know that he lives,

714
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,460
listen,

715
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,780
what good is saying

716
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm sorry

717
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,680
and even a bunch

718
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,180
of tears

719
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,400
when tomorrow

720
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,160
you and I

721
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,720
if we're living

722
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,460
in deliberate sin,

723
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,380
we know we're going

724
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,960
to get up and do

725
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,660
the same thing

726
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,400
we did today,

727
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,460
what kind of sorrow

728
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,400
do you call that?

729
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,180
If that isn't

730
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
hypocritical sorrow,

731
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,180
I never heard of it,

732
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,480
that's the magic

733
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,940
word,

734
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,340
but you see,

735
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,360
deliberate sin,

736
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,260
it says,

737
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,860
did you say you're

738
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,240
sorry?

739
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:29,940
Oh,

740
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,560
if you said you're

741
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,780
sorry,

742
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,480
that's all you have

743
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,720
to do,

744
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,800
everything's okie-dokie,

745
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,500
oh,

746
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,600
okay now,

747
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,460
you're all set,

748
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,520
as long as you told

749
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,020
him today you're

750
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,360
sorry,

751
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,600
and if you can cry

752
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,940
a little bit,

753
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,960
that's a lot better,

754
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
that is in repentance,

755
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
what happens if

756
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,100
Samson can happen

757
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,820
to you and me,

758
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,300
and if we say

759
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,100
that to ourselves

760
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,700
this morning,

761
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,440
then it happens

762
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,240
through the trickery

763
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,340
of deliberate sin,

764
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,880
when in your life

765
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,340
and I,

766
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,880
we choose to do

767
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,600
that which we know

768
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,080
is wrong,

769
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
we don't have to,

770
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,860
but we do it

771
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
because we want

772
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,660
to do it,

773
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,880
that's the reason,

774
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,300
when we admit

775
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,900
that this thing

776
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,480
can happen,

777
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,620
that we can lose

778
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,460
Christ and everything

779
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,420
that he stands for

780
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,900
and everything he's

781
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,940
given us and not

782
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,680
have the slightest

783
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
inkling that he's

784
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
gone to be

785
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,020
absolutely unaware

786
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,140
of his being

787
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,000
taken from us

788
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
and absolutely

789
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,380
to feel to ourselves

790
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,180
that we have

791
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,080
no realization,

792
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
we have no sick

793
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,060
sense that he's

794
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,580
with us,

795
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,940
it can happen

796
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,800
through deliberate

797
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,380
sin,

798
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,400
it's a damnable

799
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,860
thing,

800
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,380
when this morning

801
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,080
you and I say

802
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,820
it can happen

803
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,460
to you and it

804
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,340
can happen to me

805
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,000
and no one is

806
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,480
immune,

807
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
then if we again

808
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,140
see deliberate

809
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,400
sin into our lives,

810
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,040
then this is a

811
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,220
good time right now

812
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,140
to repent

813
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,160
and to repent

814
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,040
as we should

815
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,560
repent,

816
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,120
what happened

817
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,880
to Samson?

818
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,360
When they saw

819
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,860
him in weakness

820
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,760
they tied him up

821
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,220
and the first

822
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,660
thing they did

823
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,260
they gouged

824
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,440
his eyes out,

825
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,240
they blinded him

826
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,660
you see,

827
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,980
they were smacking

828
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,140
themselves in revenge,

829
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,460
we'll blind

830
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,400
this weakling

831
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
and they put him

832
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,980
on display,

833
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,540
they took him

834
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,240
out and he

835
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,880
took the place

836
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,420
of the horses

837
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,020
and the mules

838
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,640
and the donkeys,

839
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,880
he ground out

840
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,840
the grain

841
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,560
and the threshing

842
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,060
floors,

843
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,220
they used him

844
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,020
as an animal,

845
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,940
a blind man,

846
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,500
but in that

847
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,140
blindness,

848
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,560
in that suffering,

849
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,340
Samson began

850
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,980
to realize

851
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,440
what he had

852
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,820
done,

853
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:15,960
he began

854
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,640
to realize

855
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,160
that because

856
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,900
of his life,

857
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,580
because of

858
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:18,940
the way he

859
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,260
lived,

860
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,820
what he did

861
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,500
that was wrong,

862
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
he came to

863
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,940
himself,

864
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,500
and it was

865
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,320
through suffering,

866
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,600
what about

867
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,160
repentance,

868
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,580
what do you

869
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,000
mean?

870
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,480
Ought not this

871
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,300
be the time

872
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,020
in your life

873
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,540
and mine

874
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,360
when we say

875
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,200
if there is

876
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,900
deliberate sin,

877
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,400
what is it?

878
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,060
What is the

879
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,180
deliberate sin?

880
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,020
To repent,

881
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,780
oh listen,

882
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,500
it's the hardest

883
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,980
thing in the

884
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,240
world,

885
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,660
if you and I

886
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,120
are hating

887
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
somebody this

888
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,580
morning,

889
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
the reason we're

890
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,440
hating is because

891
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,160
we want to

892
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,680
and we're getting

893
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,540
a thrill out of

894
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,700
it,

895
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,860
can you take it

896
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,240
out of your

897
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,800
heart this

898
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,380
morning and

899
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,880
me out of

900
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,520
mine if it's

901
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,140
there and can

902
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,740
you lay it at

903
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,360
the cross of

904
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Christ and say

905
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm sorry,

906
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,320
if you can,

907
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,460
it's the hardest

908
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,500
damnable thing

909
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,200
you ever did

910
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,820
in your life,

911
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,340
you might as well

912
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,040
cut your eyes

913
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,400
out,

914
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,920
there isn't

915
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,300
anything,

916
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,660
listen,

917
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,320
there is no

918
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,260
repentance without

919
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,860
suffering,

920
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,160
you mean to

921
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,680
tell me if

922
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,020
you've got

923
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,660
another woman

924
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,680
on the spring

925
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,260
and this is

926
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,500
going on and

927
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,080
this is the

928
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,700
day when you

929
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,360
say that's

930
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,900
deliberate and

931
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm going to

932
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,660
stop,

933
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,080
do you mean to

934
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,520
tell me it's

935
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,820
easy?

936
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,660
You've never

937
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,420
done anything

938
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,300
harder in your

939
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,600
life,

940
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,060
you might as

941
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,540
well cut your

942
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,500
right arm off,

943
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,440
there is no

944
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,820
repentance without

945
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,500
suffering,

946
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,360
whoever told you

947
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,900
it was easy,

948
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,920
could we this

949
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,560
morning before

950
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,580
God and man

951
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,500
say this is

952
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,460
deliberate sin if

953
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,140
there is one

954
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,700
and lay it on

955
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,580
the altar and

956
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,440
say God I'm

957
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,300
done with it,

958
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,720
you might as

959
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,420
well cut your

960
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,440
heart out because

961
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,360
it hurts,

962
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,340
Samson had to

963
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,040
have his eyes

964
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,380
gouged out before

965
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
he came to his

966
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,820
senses,

967
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,760
then and only

968
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
then can we

969
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,460
know that it

970
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,500
didn't happen to

971
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,920
us,

972
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
that if Christ

973
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,820
left he's back

974
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,280
again,

975
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,320
because only

976
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,340
when we are

977
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,960
free from

978
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
deliberate sin

979
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,020
can we have

980
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,680
any assurance

981
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,380
that Christ

982
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,960
lives within

983
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,100
darkness,

984
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,460
there is no

985
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,140
assurance in

986
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,640
saying I'm

987
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,300
not conscious

988
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,980
that he's ever

989
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,480
gone,

990
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,660
he must live

991
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,560
within me,

992
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,940
you and I

993
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,200
can lose him

994
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,980
and lose him

995
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,400
and be the

996
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
last one in the

997
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,700
world to know

998
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,280
it through

999
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,380
deliberate sin,

1000
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,920
and when

1001
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,560
again we can

1002
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,340
lay them at his

1003
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,920
altar this

1004
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,760
morning like

1005
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
pulling teeth

1006
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,460
and cutting out

1007
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,060
an eye or

1008
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,760
cutting off our

1009
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,500
right leg or

1010
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,000
an arm,

1011
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,540
then we can

1012
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,680
say again it

1013
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,320
hasn't happened,

1014
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,260
I have him,

1015
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
then we'll not

1016
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,240
have this

1017
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,040
disillusionment,

1018
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
imagine what it

1019
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,360
means to die

1020
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,620
and to say I've

1021
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,260
got Jesus,

1022
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,240
he lives in my

1023
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,540
heart,

1024
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,240
yes he does,

1025
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,240
and yet here we

1026
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,520
are as the old

1027
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,220
hymn says,

1028
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,280
deluded souls

1029
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,160
that dream of

1030
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,240
heaven and make

1031
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,760
their empty

1032
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,700
boast of inward

1033
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,880
joys and sins

1034
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,740
forgiven when

1035
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,440
they are slaves

1036
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,180
to lust,

1037
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,140
what would it

1038
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,820
mean to stand

1039
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,620
before God

1040
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,180
if you and I

1041
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,060
would die and

1042
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,680
say oh he

1043
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,340
lives in me

1044
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:58,840
and Jesus

1045
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,400
look at you

1046
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,740
and me on

1047
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,060
the day of

1048
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,080
the day of

1049
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,260
the death,

1050
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,080
I never knew

1051
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,240
you,

1052
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,920
I left you

1053
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,560
years ago

1054
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:02,860
and you

1055
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,400
know it,

1056
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,100
I left you

1057
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,020
years ago

1058
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
deliberate sin,

1059
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,880
you drove me

1060
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,420
out of your

1061
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,720
life long ago,

1062
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,180
can you imagine

1063
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,380
any disillusionment

1064
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,800
that would be

1065
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,540
more horrible

1066
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,780
than to think

1067
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,420
we're saved

1068
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,000
and to stand

1069
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,620
before our

1070
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,260
Lord and to

1071
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,760
have him say

1072
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,400
depart from

1073
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:18,640
me,

1074
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
I don't

1075
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,180
know you,

1076
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,960
I left you

1077
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,820
years ago,

1078
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,740
oh what

1079
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,280
happened to

1080
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,060
Samson can

1081
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,820
happen to you

1082
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,280
and me,

1083
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,960
it's an ever

1084
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,440
present possibility,

1085
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,160
we can lose

1086
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,340
Jesus Christ

1087
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,640
every blessing

1088
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,420
that we have

1089
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,000
in him

1090
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
and not

1091
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,920
even know

1092
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,220
it,

1093
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,280
absolutely be

1094
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,200
unaware of

1095
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,380
it,

1096
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,000
not be

1097
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
mindful of

1098
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,020
it,

1099
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,560
have no

1100
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,260
sense that

1101
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,900
he's gone

1102
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,760
and live in

1103
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,300
a fool's

1104
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,040
paradise and

1105
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,580
say oh yes

1106
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,100
I know that

1107
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,660
he lives

1108
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,600
and have him

1109
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,240
gone long

1110
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,520
ago,

1111
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:49,800
why?

1112
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,440
Because the

1113
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,120
culprit is

1114
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,980
deliberate sin,

1115
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,180
not only

1116
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,060
does deliberate

1117
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,660
sin blind you

1118
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,740
and me to

1119
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,680
its sinfulness

1120
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,620
and blind us

1121
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,300
to its damn

1122
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,400
ableness but

1123
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,180
also this,

1124
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,340
deliberate sin

1125
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,480
blinds you and

1126
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,000
me to the

1127
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,960
horror of our

1128
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
deliberate sins

1129
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,440
but oh never

1130
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
to the horror of

1131
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,880
the deliberate

1132
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,440
sins of others,

1133
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,500
oh you know

1134
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,080
talk about

1135
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,920
deliberate sin,

1136
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,720
talk about

1137
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,140
something that

1138
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,160
can do some

1139
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,120
trickery in your

1140
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,980
life and mine,

1141
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,200
you see this

1142
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,340
thing blinds,

1143
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,440
when I embark

1144
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,040
on a life of

1145
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,700
sins again that

1146
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,360
are deliberate

1147
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,540
and again are

1148
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,040
willful,

1149
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,640
it blinds me

1150
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,700
that I don't

1151
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,020
see my sins

1152
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,660
but oh God

1153
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,920
do I see the

1154
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,980
sins of others,

1155
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,840
you know have

1156
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,540
you ever wondered

1157
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,280
about this,

1158
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,040
just you have a

1159
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,100
deliberate sin

1160
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,920
in your life

1161
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,140
and then you see

1162
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,920
it in somebody

1163
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,080
else and oh

1164
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,560
you ought to

1165
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,320
listen to yourself,

1166
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,480
you can look

1167
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
look at that

1168
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,200
guy,

1169
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,160
look at the

1170
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,540
way he hates,

1171
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,500
oh you never

1172
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,220
got so much

1173
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,900
righteous in

1174
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,440
the initial life,

1175
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,540
look at that

1176
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,500
woman chaser,

1177
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,420
look at that

1178
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,360
guy that breaks

1179
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,000
up a home,

1180
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,120
look at that

1181
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,060
guy that doesn't

1182
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,880
care about his

1183
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,060
kids,

1184
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,140
look at that

1185
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,200
skin flint in

1186
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,620
business,

1187
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,400
look at that

1188
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,100
guy that would

1189
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,860
take the pennies

1190
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,440
off a dead

1191
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,180
man's eyes,

1192
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,120
what are you

1193
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,500
doing?

1194
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:11,880
You're

1195
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,220
castigating him

1196
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,060
and damming

1197
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,280
him,

1198
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,700
why?

1199
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Because you're

1200
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,260
never any worse

1201
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,920
on him and

1202
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,200
it's down in

1203
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,580
here,

1204
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,060
we call that

1205
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,880
in psychology

1206
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,760
projection,

1207
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,000
you see we

1208
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,600
get relief,

1209
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,600
take ours that

1210
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,700
bother us and

1211
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,260
throw our

1212
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,960
deliberate sins

1213
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,560
on somebody

1214
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,920
else and

1215
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,620
then just

1216
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,560
wail into

1217
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,960
them,

1218
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,900
makes us feel

1219
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,300
better,

1220
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,500
we get them

1221
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:35,840
told,

1222
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,380
you see,

1223
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,540
we make it

1224
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,840
look like

1225
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,140
they've got a

1226
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,500
great big

1227
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,420
plank and ours

1228
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,980
is just a

1229
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,500
little old

1230
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,980
piece of

1231
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,440
sliver,

1232
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,860
that's

1233
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,520
projection,

1234
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,620
oh how it

1235
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
can blind us,

1236
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,780
and then it

1237
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,660
blinds us in

1238
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,260
this way when

1239
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,920
it does that,

1240
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,660
it takes Christ

1241
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,160
out of our

1242
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,540
hearts,

1243
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,020
it blinds us to

1244
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,780
the reality that

1245
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,020
he's gone and

1246
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,760
then it turns

1247
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,480
around and it

1248
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,620
deceives us into

1249
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,560
saying we're

1250
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,340
just so much

1251
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,020
better than

1252
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,620
others that

1253
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,140
Christ would

1254
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,960
never think of

1255
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,560
leaving us,

1256
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,720
if you want to

1257
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
get a self-righteous

1258
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,220
binge,

1259
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,940
you and I can

1260
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,440
get it in

1261
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,380
deliberate sin,

1262
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,400
then just

1263
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,180
project it on

1264
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,120
somebody else and

1265
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,140
wail the tar out

1266
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,380
of them and get

1267
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,060
them told,

1268
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,820
because again,

1269
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,500
makes us feel

1270
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,700
good down here

1271
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,040
because there

1272
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,420
is no blasphemy,

1273
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,200
there is no

1274
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,160
sarcasm so

1275
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,620
great that when

1276
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,420
it comes from

1277
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,260
somebody who

1278
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,880
is guilty of

1279
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,580
delivered sin,

1280
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,840
who sees the

1281
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,580
same sin in

1282
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,560
somebody else,

1283
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,080
talk about

1284
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,460
blinding us,

1285
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,800
it can happen,

1286
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,000
yes,

1287
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,240
it happened to

1288
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,720
Samson,

1289
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,800
he again,

1290
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
he wist not,

1291
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,900
that the Lord

1292
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,760
was departed

1293
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,800
from him,

1294
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,260
and if you

1295
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,800
and I this

1296
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,320
morning can

1297
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,760
say it can

1298
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,220
happen to

1299
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,660
anybody,

1300
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,380
we can lose

1301
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,360
Christ and

1302
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,380
not know it,

1303
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,200
be the last

1304
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,020
person on

1305
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,700
earth to

1306
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,380
know it

1307
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,900
because of

1308
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,940
deliberate sin,

1309
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,780
therefore we

1310
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,360
ought to do

1311
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,780
this,

1312
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,040
we ought to

1313
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,940
every day in

1314
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,720
our life turn

1315
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,520
to Christ and

1316
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,060
pray for

1317
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,800
strength,

1318
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,880
that when

1319
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,920
deliberate sin

1320
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,600
beckons that

1321
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,220
he gives us

1322
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,920
the strength to

1323
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,460
say no,

1324
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,020
it's wrong,

1325
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,080
no,

1326
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,760
give me strength,

1327
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,720
I know it's

1328
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,060
wrong,

1329
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,120
I will not

1330
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,880
do that which

1331
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,480
I know is

1332
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,720
wrong,

1333
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,480
I don't have

1334
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,100
to do that

1335
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,700
which I know

1336
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,020
is wrong,

1337
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I don't choose

1338
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,360
to do that

1339
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,840
which is

1340
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,240
wrong,

1341
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,480
well what

1342
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,140
about old

1343
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,600
Samson,

1344
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,520
Samson when

1345
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,140
his eyes were

1346
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,460
out,

1347
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,780
when they made

1348
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,420
an animal out

1349
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:31,700
of him,

1350
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,300
he let his

1351
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,940
hair start to

1352
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,580
grow again,

1353
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,040
and they say

1354
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,480
what about

1355
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,680
him,

1356
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:37,880
well there

1357
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,260
was a big

1358
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,920
celebration

1359
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,000
down in

1360
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,480
Gaza,

1361
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,540
the same

1362
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,220
Gaza you're

1363
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,700
reading about

1364
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:42,980
today,

1365
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,500
the Gaza

1366
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,780
strip,

1367
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,440
I was in

1368
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,120
that neighborhood

1369
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,600
too,

1370
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,780
think of it

1371
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,900
over 3,000

1372
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,620
years ago

1373
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,540
Samson was

1374
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,780
in the city

1375
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,220
of Gaza

1376
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,480
and they

1377
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,400
had a temple

1378
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,980
there to

1379
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,800
their Philistine

1380
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,340
god,

1381
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,780
Dagan,

1382
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,140
in Gaza,

1383
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,820
he had been

1384
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,560
in that building

1385
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,360
evidently when

1386
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:58,880
he still had

1387
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,620
his eyesight,

1388
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,320
they're pretentious

1389
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,180
temples if you've

1390
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,680
ever been in

1391
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,200
that area,

1392
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,900
made out of

1393
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,380
stone,

1394
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,540
tremendous

1395
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,120
buildings,

1396
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,020
and a

1397
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,660
little boy

1398
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,120
let him

1399
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,340
in,

1400
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,640
he was

1401
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,420
on display

1402
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,980
and he

1403
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,440
knew that

1404
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,740
there were

1405
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,440
two center

1406
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,120
pillars that

1407
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,580
held up

1408
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,700
that magnificent

1409
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,860
temple and

1410
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,460
on the second

1411
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,020
floor of that

1412
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,500
day we were

1413
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,860
told about

1414
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,880
3,000 people

1415
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,480
on the second

1416
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:19,720
floor,

1417
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,420
let alone those

1418
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,840
on the first

1419
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,580
floor of that

1420
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:22,960
temple,

1421
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,740
it was filled

1422
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,420
with people,

1423
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:25,660
and he asked

1424
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,260
the little boy

1425
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,840
to lean him

1426
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,360
back so he

1427
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,640
could lean

1428
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,180
against the

1429
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,740
two pillars

1430
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,460
that kept

1431
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,360
the second

1432
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,100
floor of that

1433
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,700
building and

1434
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,220
the little boy

1435
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,600
did,

1436
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,680
then Samson

1437
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,660
slowly put his

1438
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,460
arms around

1439
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,040
the pillars,

1440
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,000
this man

1441
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,500
repentant now,

1442
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,440
he again,

1443
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,280
his hair was

1444
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,740
growing,

1445
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,180
he had taken

1446
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,940
back his

1447
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,100
Nazarite vow,

1448
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,280
and he prayed

1449
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,800
to God,

1450
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,440
he knew that

1451
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,160
his life would

1452
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,780
go too,

1453
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,820
and he asked

1454
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,080
God,

1455
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,600
oh God,

1456
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
give me strength

1457
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,500
that I can

1458
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,660
deliver Israel

1459
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,220
from the

1460
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,420
Philistines as

1461
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,880
you want me

1462
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,380
to do,

1463
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,920
and God gave

1464
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,640
him strength,

1465
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,820
and he started

1466
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,120
to pull on

1467
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,780
those pillars

1468
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,700
toward him,

1469
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,840
and slowly

1470
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,360
with the

1471
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,980
strength that

1472
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,680
God gave

1473
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:07,800
him,

1474
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,380
they tumbled

1475
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,700
and the

1476
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,160
roof came

1477
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,700
down,

1478
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,280
and oh

1479
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,700
again,

1480
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,440
the deaths,

1481
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,040
the leaders

1482
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,380
of the

1483
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,940
Philistines

1484
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,740
were killed,

1485
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,340
and Israel

1486
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,880
was killed,

1487
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,460
and Israel

1488
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:17,740
was killed,

1489
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:17,960
and they say,

1490
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,800
were Samson

1491
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,440
saved,

1492
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,840
how about

1493
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,420
a man

1494
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,040
when God

1495
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,020
abandoned him

1496
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,520
and he didn't

1497
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,160
even know it,

1498
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,280
we know it's

1499
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,620
wonderful,

1500
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,240
you go to the

1501
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,800
New Testament

1502
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,560
to find out,

1503
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,000
we wouldn't

1504
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,640
know if we

1505
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,360
just had the

1506
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,000
Old Testament,

1507
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,960
to go to the

1508
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,580
book of Hebrews

1509
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,120
in the New

1510
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,440
Testament,

1511
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,220
the 11th chapter,

1512
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,700
you've never

1513
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,000
read it,

1514
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,300
you want to

1515
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,660
read that

1516
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,000
chapter,

1517
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,900
that's the

1518
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,720
hall of fame

1519
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,160
of the men

1520
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,600
of faith

1521
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:37,980
of the word

1522
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,360
of God,

1523
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,860
the 11th

1524
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,280
chapter of

1525
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,620
Hebrews,

1526
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,440
and in the

1527
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,080
11th chapter

1528
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,580
of Hebrews

1529
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,680
in the 32nd

1530
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,100
verse,

1531
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,140
we find the

1532
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,580
writer of

1533
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,260
Hebrews says,

1534
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,600
and what

1535
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,300
shall I more

1536
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,700
say,

1537
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,720
he says,

1538
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,620
time would

1539
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,420
fail me,

1540
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,840
he's talking

1541
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,260
about the

1542
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,720
heroes of

1543
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:50,960
faith,

1544
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,040
time would

1545
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,980
fail me,

1546
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,760
he says,

1547
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,420
to tell of

1548
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,020
Jephthah,

1549
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,920
and of

1550
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Baric,

1551
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,320
and of

1552
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,020
Gideon,

1553
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,420
and of

1554
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,360
Samson,

1555
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,580
Samson is

1556
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,280
mentioned in

1557
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,340
the hall of

1558
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,840
fame,

1559
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,340
in the word

1560
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,960
of God,

1561
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,080
yes,

1562
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,060
he made it,

1563
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,680
God came

1564
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
back to

1565
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,620
Samson,

1566
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,400
because he

1567
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,060
came back

1568
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,840
to Samson,

1569
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,620
if it should

1570
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
be that we've

1571
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,400
lost Christ,

1572
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,800
and we aren't

1573
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,660
even aware of

1574
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:21,980
it,

1575
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,120
oh,

1576
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,700
to turn in

1577
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,560
repentance for

1578
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,520
deliberate sin,

1579
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
it happened

1580
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,900
to Samson,

1581
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,620
but God

1582
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,680
came back,

1583
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,980
and Christ

1584
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,020
will come

1585
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,540
back into

1586
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,080
your life

1587
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,640
and mine,

1588
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,160
when we

1589
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
repent with

1590
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,560
real suffering,

1591
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,920
and ask him

1592
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,900
for strength,

1593
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,120
and then it

1594
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,860
matters not

1595
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,700
what comes in

1596
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,060
life,

1597
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,300
in the

1598
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,940
emergencies of

1599
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,240
life,

1600
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,420
oh,

1601
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,740
think,

1602
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,980
how death

1603
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,560
comes into

1604
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,220
our home,

1605
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:48,980
oh,

1606
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,680
the clashing

1607
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,060
of two

1608
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,640
automobiles,

1609
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,040
and there's

1610
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,520
death in

1611
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:51,960
the moment

1612
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,580
of an eye,

1613
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,220
or death,

1614
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,820
we go in

1615
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,220
the bedroom

1616
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,780
and we find

1617
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,260
a loved one

1618
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,660
dead,

1619
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,840
with no

1620
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,340
time of

1621
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,820
preparation,

1622
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,280
you and I

1623
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,720
can say,

1624
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,580
how can I

1625
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,060
be ready

1626
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,620
for that

1627
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,060
emergency,

1628
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,980
that I'll

1629
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,360
be given

1630
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,100
no warning

1631
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,020
over this,

1632
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,140
but when

1633
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,020
again I

1634
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,600
know that

1635
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,020
deliberate

1636
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,680
sin has

1637
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,120
been taken

1638
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,540
to the

1639
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:11,980
throne of

1640
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,500
grace,

1641
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,700
and that

1642
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,580
therefore I

1643
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,120
can know

1644
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,980
that Christ

1645
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,080
has not

1646
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,900
been taken

1647
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,420
away,

1648
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,560
that I

1649
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,980
still have

1650
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,440
him,

1651
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,880
then nothing

1652
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,840
else matters

1653
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
that we can

1654
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,600
look forward

1655
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,080
to an

1656
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,540
eternity

1657
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,060
with our

1658
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,980
loved ones,

1659
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,260
who again

1660
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,040
have conquered

1661
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,540
in this

1662
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:30,840
thing of

1663
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,160
deliberate

1664
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,620
sin,

1665
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,980
oh,

1666
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,360
then we

1667
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,200
can sing

1668
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,620
and we

1669
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,580
can know

1670
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,180
it for

1671
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,780
certainty,

1672
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,700
I come

1673
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,380
to the

1674
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,420
garden alone,

1675
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,760
while the

1676
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,580
dew is still

1677
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,460
on the roses,

1678
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,460
and the

1679
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,620
voice I hear

1680
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,740
falling on

1681
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,960
my ear,

1682
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,280
the Son of

1683
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,760
God

1684
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,720
discloses,

1685
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,960
and he

1686
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,900
walks with

1687
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,240
me,

1688
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,720
and he

1689
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,560
talks with

1690
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,000
me,

1691
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:56,920
and he

1692
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,700
tells me

1693
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,500
I am his

1694
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,880
own,

1695
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,060
and the

1696
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,760
joy we

1697
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,720
share as

1698
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,460
we tarry

1699
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:02,940
there,

1700
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,500
none other

1701
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,900
has ever

1702
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,300
known,

1703
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,800
and when

1704
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,740
he tells you

1705
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,060
and me

1706
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,640
then that

1707
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,180
we are his

1708
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,560
own,

1709
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,060
we can

1710
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,000
believe it,

1711
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,040
we can

1712
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,440
know it

1713
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,300
for certainty,

1714
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
when in

1715
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,660
him we

1716
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,960
have

1717
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,620
conquered

1718
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,020
deliberate

1719
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,280
sin,

1720
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,960
amen,

1721
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,860
the

1722
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,200
peace

1723
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,880
of God

1724
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,240
which

1725
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,800
passeth

1726
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,400
all human

1727
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,300
understanding,

1728
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,340
keep and

1729
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,940
unite your

1730
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,540
hearts and

1731
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,260
minds in

1732
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,200
Christ Jesus

1733
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,580
unto life

1734
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,460
everlasting,

1735
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,820
