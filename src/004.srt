1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,240
Let us hear the word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,980
as we find it written in the first letter of Peter, the second chapter, especially the 21st verse.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,140
For even hereunto were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us,

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,600
leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,200
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,380
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
In Christ Jesus, our risen Lord, dear friends,

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,880
you who are here in God's house this morning,

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,300
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,700
This morning, the Apostle Peter, the big fisherman from up Galilee Way,

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,260
speaks to us through the word of God.

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,420
And the big fisherman says to us,

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,700
and it is Jesus' wish that you and I follow his steps,

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,000
that you and I walk in his steps,

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,380
that we follow his example.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,820
When we say to ourselves,

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,680
what does Peter mean by that?

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,140
How are we to follow Jesus and to walk in his steps?

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,920
The Apostle Peter hastens to tell us

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,240
just exactly what he means,

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,100
for he says that Christ suffered for us,

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
leaving us an example,

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,480
that we should follow his steps.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,480
In other words, Peter says,

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,680
what the Lord wants of you is this,

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,380
that you will walk in his steps,

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,200
you will follow his pattern,

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,440
his example in this matter of suffering,

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,560
the matter of enduring suffering

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,300
as Christians,

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,880
as followers of Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,760
In other words, Peter says,

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
this is what your Lord wants of you.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,880
He wants you to walk in his steps

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
in this matter of suffering

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
because you are a Christian,

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,160
because you believe in Christ as your Savior,

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,280
because you want to live

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
as Christ wants you to live,

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,660
because you want to treat your neighbor

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,300
exactly as Christ wants you to do so.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
And Peter says,

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,020
in that matter of suffering,

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,040
Jesus wants you to walk in his steps

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,060
to follow his example.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,940
Then you and I say,

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,220
well, how did Jesus endure suffering?

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,420
What was the way in which he accepted

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,180
those things that came to him?

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,120
And again, the big fisherman from Galilee Way

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,420
gives us an example

53
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,540
and tells us exactly how that occurred

54
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,960
by telling us this,

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,260
that he, when he was reviled,

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,360
he reviled not again.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,080
When he was suffering,

58
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,680
he threatened not.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,520
Peter says,

60
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,580
this is the way your Lord suffered.

61
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,820
When they heaped all manner of ridicule on him,

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,260
he didn't throw it back into their faces.

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,040
When they reviled him,

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,680
he didn't revile back and retort in kind.

65
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,180
When they looked at him

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,400
and they insulted him,

67
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,040
he didn't turn insult against them.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
When he suffered,

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,660
he didn't threaten them with vengeance.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,740
He wasn't filled with bitterness.

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,440
He wasn't filled with resentment.

72
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,680
He didn't say,

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,180
I'll get even with you

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,800
if it's the last thing that I ever do.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
And so Peter says,

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,940
this is what your Lord wants.

77
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,500
He wants you to walk in his steps.

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,480
He wants you to follow his example

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,760
with regard to this matter of suffering as a Christian.

80
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,520
He wants you to endure it patiently,

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,660
to endure it gently,

82
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,500
to endure it without any bitterness,

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,180
without any resentment,

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,000
without any spirit of revenge.

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,660
And say, Christian friends,

86
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,300
that's quite an order, isn't it?

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,460
You and I say,

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,420
do you mean to say

89
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,680
that Jesus wants me to walk in his steps,

90
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,680
that I am to follow his example

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,900
with regard to suffering,

92
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,840
that when again men inflict

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,420
all manner of abuse on me

94
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,520
because I'm a Christian,

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
that I've got to take it?

96
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,020
Do you mean to say

97
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,200
that I am to accept it in all patience,

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,740
that I am to bring it to myself gently,

99
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,160
that I am not to blow off the handle,

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
I am not to seek revenge?

101
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,120
Do you mean to say

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,780
that that's what I am to do?

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,580
And we say that's a big order

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,960
and the reason why it seems

105
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,600
like a big order to you and me is this.

106
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,140
We say that suffering

107
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,400
that comes to a Christian

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,660
is absolutely uncalled for,

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,380
it's absolutely undeserved.

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,000
And right you are, my friends, it is.

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,640
There is no reason in God's world

112
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,060
why a Christian ought to suffer

113
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,280
because he's a Christian.

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,500
There is absolutely no justification

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,600
for any suffering to come to a Christian

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
because he believes in Jesus Christ.

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,060
The world has no reason to do so.

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,240
You are so right.

119
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,520
It is absolutely unjustified.

120
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,420
It is absolutely undeserved.

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,420
It is uncalled for.

122
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,100
But the fact still remains

123
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,120
that when you and I are Christians,

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,860
there come sufferings to us.

125
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,420
And Jesus says,

126
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,200
walk in my paths

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,120
and accept that impatience

128
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,100
with no bitterness,

129
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,080
no resentment,

130
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,380
no spirit of revenge.

131
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,580
It is undeserved.

132
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
But Christ wants you and me to know this,

133
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,100
that this enduring of suffering

134
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
that is absolutely undeserved

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
and enduring it patiently,

136
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,600
it ought to be the thrill

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,060
of your Christian life and mine.

138
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,360
It ought to be something that we say,

139
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,400
this is what I want to do

140
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,500
more than anything else.

141
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,640
It ought to fill us with enthusiasm.

142
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,960
It ought to be the experience

143
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,060
of all experiences

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,940
in our Christian life.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,660
And we may say,

146
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,300
how so?

147
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,700
Do you mean to say

148
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,840
that we ought to thrill

149
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,540
when we suffer as a Christian

150
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,140
and therefore there should be

151
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,660
no bitterness,

152
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,400
no resentment,

153
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,540
that we ought to gladly

154
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,480
walk in the paths of Jesus

155
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,820
and follow his example?

156
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,880
Exactly.

157
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,420
Because let's realize

158
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,560
in the first place this,

159
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,300
that it was by this very kind

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,940
of suffering

161
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,000
that Jesus our Lord

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,240
brought for you and me

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,340
our redemption

164
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,300
from hell

165
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,640
and from damnation.

166
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,940
Do you realize

167
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,980
that that's the kind

168
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,400
of suffering Jesus endured?

169
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,300
Did Christ deserve

170
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,260
what he got

171
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,320
the crown of thorns?

172
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,520
Did he deserve

173
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,260
to have men spit in his face?

174
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,240
Did he deserve

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,800
to have men

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
to take the reed

177
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,660
and crack him in the face?

178
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,720
Did he deserve

179
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,620
to be scourged?

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,380
Did he deserve

181
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,700
to be nailed to the cross?

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,700
Did he do something

183
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,800
that again would cause

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
men to do that justly?

185
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,340
And the apostle Peter,

186
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,080
the big fisherman,

187
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
says he was without sin.

188
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,100
Peter knew him

189
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,140
as a sinless one

190
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,480
who had lived in this world

191
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,180
without sin

192
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,920
because he was

193
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,020
the eternal son of God.

194
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,300
Peter said there wasn't

195
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,180
even any guile

196
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,840
in his mouth.

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,940
There wasn't any semblance

198
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,000
of sin in him,

199
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,920
not even to the point

200
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,840
that he tried by his words

201
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
to soft soap anybody.

202
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,200
Peter said he was

203
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,940
without sin

204
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,240
and yet it was

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,460
undeserved suffering,

206
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,080
it was innocent suffering

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,420
and the very fact

208
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,940
that Christ

209
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,000
brought it in patience

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
that there was no bitterness,

211
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,100
there was no resentment,

212
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,240
it means that

213
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,900
by that very suffering,

214
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,060
Jesus brought escape

215
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,280
from eternal death

216
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,840
and hell

217
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,660
for you and me.

218
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,160
We ought to realize

219
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,520
that had he been a sinner,

220
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,220
had he accepted this

221
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,580
with a spirit of revenge,

222
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,420
had he said,

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm going to get even with you,

224
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,620
there would be no deliverance

225
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,820
from eternal hell

226
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,520
for the world.

227
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,440
But because he suffered

228
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,120
innocently

229
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,280
and because he did it

230
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
gladly and willingly,

231
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,240
when he went to Calvary's cross,

232
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,300
he bore your guilt

233
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,160
and he bore mine

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,880
and he bought the eternal punishment

235
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,680
of our sins

236
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,260
and in that sufferings and death

237
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,040
because it was undeserved suffering

238
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,520
and death

239
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
for him who was

240
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,620
the eternal son of God,

241
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,440
there was brought for you

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
and me deliverance

243
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
from eternal death,

244
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
soul and body in hell.

245
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,700
And therefore,

246
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,480
when we walk in his steps

247
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
with regard to this matter

248
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,460
of suffering as Christians,

249
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,260
we ought to say,

250
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
it's the thrill of a lifetime

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,720
because it's the evidence

252
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
in your life and mine

253
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,340
that your faith and mine

254
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,060
is genuine

255
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,720
and that in Jesus Christ

256
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,100
we do have deliverance

257
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,020
from eternal death

258
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,160
and eternal damnation.

259
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,740
We may say to ourselves,

260
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,720
how do I know

261
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,660
that I'm a Christian?

262
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,020
How do I know

263
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,920
that I'm saved?

264
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,800
How do I know

265
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,260
that I have been rescued

266
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,380
from eternal death

267
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,080
and damnation?

268
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,600
You and I need to look

269
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,280
at our life

270
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,300
and let's look here

271
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,420
in the acid test.

272
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,500
How do we accept suffering

273
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,760
because we're a Christian?

274
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,520
Do we accept it in patience?

275
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
Do we accept it gently?

276
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,460
Or are you and I bitter?

277
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,780
And do we retort

278
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,140
with all manner of epithets

279
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,120
that are cast at us?

280
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,340
And do we have

281
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,560
a spirit of revenge?

282
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,300
Listen, friend.

283
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,400
If there is a spirit of revenge

284
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,500
in your heart and mine

285
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,020
because we are Christians,

286
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,400
there is no resemblance

287
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,760
between us and our Lord.

288
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,280
If you and I are Christians

289
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,700
and our faith is genuine,

290
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,120
there ought to be

291
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,380
some similarity

292
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,580
between Jesus

293
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,880
and between you and me.

294
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
And if all that we have

295
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,820
because we suffer

296
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,000
as Christians is bitterness,

297
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,880
we ought to say to ourselves,

298
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,780
my faith is a sham faith.

299
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,240
My faith is not

300
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
a living faith in him.

301
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,900
He endured it gladly

302
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,440
and it was innocent suffering.

303
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,460
But if all that you and I

304
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,120
have is a spirit of revenge

305
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
and I'll get even,

306
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
we ought to say to ourselves,

307
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,660
we are not Christians.

308
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,320
We are not saved.

309
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,520
We do not belong to him

310
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,720
because there is no similarity

311
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
whatsoever between Christ and us.

312
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,220
And that's why today

313
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,520
when the big fisherman says,

314
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,780
this is what your Lord asks,

315
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,180
that you walk in his steps,

316
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,720
and that means with regard

317
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
to your suffering as a Christian,

318
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,360
then we ought to say to ourselves,

319
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,540
this is the thing

320
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,940
that I shall determine to do,

321
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,320
that I want to walk in his steps.

322
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
I want to walk according to the example

323
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
that he has left.

324
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,680
I as a Christian,

325
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,020
I want to endure

326
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,740
what comes to me as a Christian

327
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,120
and I want to do it

328
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,840
without bitterness

329
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,420
and without a sense of resentment

330
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,820
and without a spirit

331
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,720
of getting even.

332
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,880
And when there is

333
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,580
that determination,

334
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
then we're going to realize this,

335
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,160
that in the Christian life,

336
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,860
listen,

337
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,500
this suffering is inseparable

338
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,080
with being a child of God.

339
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,980
Peter said,

340
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,720
for hereunto were you called.

341
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,220
How many of us realize

342
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,920
that with the Christian life,

343
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,640
there comes suffering?

344
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,500
How many of us this morning

345
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,080
have to say,

346
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,020
well, it's been pretty easy

347
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,040
so far as a Christian.

348
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,680
I don't think that I've suffered

349
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,640
anything particularly

350
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,700
being a child of God.

351
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,360
Haven't you?

352
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Haven't you?

353
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,560
When again,

354
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,860
suffering follows

355
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,840
being a Christian

356
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,980
as the morning follows the night.

357
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,260
Haven't you ever suffered

358
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,820
any ridicule from the world

359
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,000
because as a Christian,

360
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,920
you believe that Jesus Christ

361
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,540
was the eternal Son of God,

362
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,100
your Lord,

363
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
that he was born of a virgin,

364
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,540
that he arose from the dead?

365
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,380
Hasn't the world

366
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,600
ever laughed at you

367
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,540
for believing

368
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,820
that somebody dead

369
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
could rise again?

370
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,140
Hasn't the world

371
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,200
ever stood and made fun of you

372
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,460
because you believe

373
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,180
in the deity of Jesus Christ?

374
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,440
Hasn't the world

375
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
ever made fun of you

376
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,520
that you believe

377
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,900
that Christ is coming again?

378
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
Where have you been?

379
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
Perhaps the world

380
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,840
doesn't know

381
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,900
that you're a Christian.

382
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,900
You can't live a day

383
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,520
without paying the price.

384
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,100
Can you?

385
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,700
Do you mean to say

386
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,840
that you've never suffered

387
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,640
any ridicule

388
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
because you lived Jesus Christ?

389
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,080
You young people,

390
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,680
when it comes to a matter

391
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,460
of whether you're going

392
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,820
to be popular or not,

393
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
and when you've got to say,

394
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't live that way

395
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,180
because I'm a Christian,

396
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,100
you mean to tell me

397
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,540
that you've never suffered ridicule

398
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,600
and somebody called you

399
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,220
a square

400
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,540
or whatever you're supposed to be?

401
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,840
what kind of a Christian are you

402
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,620
and what kind of a Christian am I

403
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,800
if we don't pay the price

404
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,820
of being a Christian?

405
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,320
If again there is

406
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,400
no ridicule

407
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,420
and no laughter

408
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,500
and no embarrassment

409
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,440
to you and me

410
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,220
as a Christian,

411
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,700
then pray,

412
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,220
God,

413
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,120
let's take a look

414
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,920
at ourselves.

415
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,880
We are mighty

416
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,340
poor examples

417
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,440
of a Christian.

418
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,460
The world doesn't know it.

419
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,760
Oh,

420
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,180
we don't deserve it.

421
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,020
You say,

422
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,040
why does the world

423
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,920
hate a Christian

424
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,400
when you and I say

425
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm going to treat my neighbor

426
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,580
the way Christ

427
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,600
wants me to treat him?

428
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,660
And I'll turn the other cheek

429
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,560
and the world stands

430
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,480
and laughs and said,

431
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,700
why,

432
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,820
you're a big goof.

433
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,340
Talk about being a screwball

434
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,760
that you'll turn the other cheek

435
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,100
and let the other man

436
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,240
take advantage of you.

437
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,980
Do you mean to tell me

438
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,760
that you and I

439
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
have never suffered

440
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,260
for being a Christian?

441
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,420
But why does the world

442
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,280
hate a Christian?

443
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,020
Do you know why?

444
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,540
Let's put it down

445
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,180
in our hearts

446
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,740
and never forget.

447
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:38,980
Listen,

448
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,840
the world hates you

449
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
and me as a Christian

450
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,400
because we stand

451
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
as living memories

452
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,000
to a man of the world

453
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
that if what you and I

454
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,520
believe about Christ

455
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,980
is true,

456
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
that man knows

457
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,600
he's damned.

458
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't forget that.

459
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,980
When you and I

460
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,900
stand and say

461
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,960
this is Christ

462
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,820
who is the only

463
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,940
Savior from sin,

464
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
bear in mind

465
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,340
that the man of the world

466
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,940
that looks at you

467
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,540
and me and says

468
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,520
if what that guy

469
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,040
believes

470
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,600
is right

471
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,180
then I'm lost

472
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,340
and let me tell you

473
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,020
when the world

474
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,940
looks at you and me

475
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,460
and the world knows

476
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,080
that he's lost

477
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,000
because he doesn't

478
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,480
have Christ

479
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,900
he hates you and me

480
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,520
with a vengeance

481
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,760
and don't ever forget it.

482
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,040
The only way

483
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,680
in God's world

484
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,360
you can ever keep

485
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
the world from hating you

486
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,060
is to make sure

487
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,720
that you don't let

488
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,180
the world know

489
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,980
that you're a Christian.

490
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,560
And listen,

491
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,720
you can't compromise

492
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,340
it either.

493
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,400
There isn't any

494
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,960
compromise

495
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,700
between heaven and hell,

496
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,080
between Christ

497
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,800
and the world,

498
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,860
between sin

499
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,500
and righteousness.

500
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
it just isn't there.

501
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,960
If you and I

502
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,040
can say this morning

503
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,820
as a Christian

504
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,460
it's been a pretty easy road,

505
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,680
for God's sakes

506
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,660
look in the mirror.

507
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
What kind of a Christian

508
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,660
are you?

509
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,320
What kind of a Christian

510
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,860
am I?

511
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,040
That's why

512
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
the big fisherman

513
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,980
up Galilee Way

514
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,920
says this is what

515
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,660
your Lord wants.

516
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,980
He wants you to walk

517
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,740
in his steps.

518
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,640
He wants you to follow

519
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,360
his example

520
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,780
with regard to this thing

521
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,200
of suffering

522
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,260
because you're a Christian.

523
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,340
He wants you to bear it

524
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,020
even though

525
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,200
it is absolutely unjustified.

526
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,260
It is absolutely undeserved.

527
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,880
But bear it patiently.

528
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,260
No bitterness,

529
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,480
no resentment,

530
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,180
no spirit of revenge.

531
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,800
And you and I say,

532
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,300
why?

533
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,580
Because it's undeserved.

534
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:11,940
But listen,

535
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,500
it ought to be

536
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,640
the thrill of a lifetime.

537
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,020
It ought to be

538
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,380
that which inspires you

539
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,640
and me

540
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,740
beyond everything else

541
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,540
to say,

542
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,680
this is an honor.

543
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,320
It's an honor

544
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,780
to bear undeserved

545
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,800
suffering gladly

546
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,400
for Christ.

547
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,780
Why?

548
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,700
Because that kind

549
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,160
of suffering

550
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,980
in the second place

551
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,820
was exactly

552
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,740
the kind of suffering

553
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,760
that Jesus endured

554
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,240
whereby he became

555
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,280
the great good shepherd

556
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,140
and the overseer

557
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,980
of our souls.

558
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,340
What made him

559
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,120
the good shepherd

560
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,880
that he could say,

561
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
I am the good shepherd?

562
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,080
Did he not say

563
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,060
because the good shepherd

564
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,880
gave his life

565
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,480
for the sheep?

566
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,700
How does it come

567
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,720
that God raised him

568
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,400
from the dead?

569
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,460
How does it come

570
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,500
that as the good shepherd

571
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,260
he is the one

572
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,340
that sits at the right hand

573
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,780
of God,

574
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,180
the one that rules

575
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,760
the world,

576
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,540
the one who holds

577
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,040
the world

578
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
in the very hollow

579
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,660
of his hand,

580
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,100
the one who rules

581
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,580
the world

582
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,460
for you and me,

583
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,120
how does it come

584
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
that he's the good shepherd?

585
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,500
Isn't it this?

586
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,820
Because the suffering

587
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,960
that he endured

588
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,520
patiently

589
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,560
without bitterness,

590
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,120
it was undeserved suffering.

591
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,460
He didn't deserve

592
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,780
the deal he got,

593
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,300
did he?

594
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,220
And because he didn't,

595
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,940
he did it for you

596
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,300
and me.

597
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,200
In his own self,

598
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,780
yes,

599
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,920
in his own body,

600
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,020
he bare our sins

601
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,940
on the tree.

602
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,640
And because he is

603
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,360
the good shepherd

604
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
and the overseer

605
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,080
of your soul

606
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,540
and mine,

607
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,240
listen,

608
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,260
he is the one

609
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,180
that overrules

610
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,300
everything for your

611
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,200
good and mine.

612
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,580
We can't have

613
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,340
that conviction

614
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,260
that he overrules

615
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,020
good for us

616
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,260
unless you and I

617
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,940
can say,

618
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I belong to him

619
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,600
and my faith

620
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,380
trusts this

621
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,500
that because

622
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
I shall endure

623
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,460
what the world

624
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,360
sends me

625
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,120
with joy

626
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,960
and it'll be

627
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,140
the thrill of my life,

628
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,100
only then

629
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,860
can you and I

630
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,660
say he is working

631
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,740
these things for good.

632
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
Does he as the great

633
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,580
good shepherd overrule

634
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,120
for good?

635
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,520
Did you ever see

636
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,540
the greatest reversal

637
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,380
that has ever taken

638
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,460
place in human history?

639
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,540
Bear in mind,

640
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,680
he died on the tree.

641
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,020
And listen,

642
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,840
when Peter uses

643
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,660
that word tree,

644
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,660
he uses it the way

645
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,760
they used it in that day.

646
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,540
The most horrible death

647
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,720
that could come to a man,

648
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,360
I mean the most

649
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,980
ignominious,

650
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,800
the most low type

651
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,340
of death

652
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,960
that could come

653
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,160
was death on the cross.

654
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,780
Jesus might have died

655
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,720
by being beheaded,

656
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,820
but that was honorable.

657
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
But to die on the cross,

658
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,860
anybody that died

659
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,480
on the tree

660
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,460
was known as one

661
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,780
who was accursed of God.

662
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
You were the lowest

663
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
type of humanity

664
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
that could exist.

665
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,520
You were really

666
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,280
an outcast

667
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,060
and he died

668
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,200
in the lowest form

669
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,660
of death

670
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,800
that could ever come

671
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,440
to a man.

672
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,240
They nailed him

673
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,820
to a tree.

674
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,380
And you talk about

675
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,120
the overruling

676
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,060
providence of God,

677
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,580
what happened?

678
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,280
They nailed him

679
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,760
to a tree.

680
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,360
But isn't it strange

681
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,260
that horrible,

682
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,020
detestable mode of death?

683
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,060
You're sitting in a church

684
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,160
that is laid out

685
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,600
in the form of a cross.

686
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,040
How in the world

687
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,760
could something

688
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,920
so detestable

689
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,780
as a cross

690
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,500
become a symbol of joy?

691
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,440
How does it come

692
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,020
that many of you

693
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,780
have lavaliers

694
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,400
and necklaces

695
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,120
around your neck

696
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
in the form of a cross?

697
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:55,600
Why?

698
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,560
Because that lowly,

699
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,540
detestable,

700
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,520
ignoble,

701
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,740
despicable death

702
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,260
was overruled

703
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,000
in the providence

704
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,460
of God

705
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,180
that it's become

706
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,420
the symbol of life.

707
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,460
That's why

708
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,040
as you sit here

709
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,440
this morning

710
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,140
there's the cross

711
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,760
on the altar.

712
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
Some churches

713
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,220
have the corpus,

714
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,080
the body on it,

715
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,260
which calls attention

716
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,840
to the death.

717
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,460
Some of us

718
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,620
have the body off of it,

719
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,640
which means that he died

720
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,580
but he arose again.

721
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,040
Either one

722
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,020
is perfectly all right.

723
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
Why is it that the cross

724
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,360
is a symbol

725
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,340
of honor and distinction?

726
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,540
Because it was

727
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
the greatest reversal

728
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,700
that has ever taken place

729
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,460
in human history.

730
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,740
You wouldn't wear

731
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,760
an electric chair

732
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,660
around your neck.

733
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,340
You wouldn't wear

734
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,660
a noose around your neck,

735
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,500
a gallows.

736
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,100
You wouldn't wear

737
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,040
a gas chamber.

738
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,720
But we wear the cross.

739
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,120
Why?

740
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,180
Because Christ,

741
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,960
the Good Shepherd,

742
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,340
has overruled

743
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,720
the most ignominious death

744
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,460
that ever occurred

745
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,600
for the redemption

746
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,140
of the world.

747
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,540
And listen,

748
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,060
it ought to be

749
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,000
the thrill of your life

750
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,400
and mine

751
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,060
when we walk

752
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,760
in his steps

753
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,900
to say again,

754
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
I count it an honor

755
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,740
and a distinction

756
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,780
to suffer for him

757
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,600
and to do it

758
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,280
without bitterness

759
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,140
because then we have

760
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,700
the evidence

761
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
that our faith

762
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,720
really trusts him

763
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,140
and that he's overruling

764
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
everything for good.

765
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,400
Listen,

766
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,720
nothing comes into your life

767
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,860
except by his permission.

768
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,300
We're talking about

769
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,320
the things that we bear

770
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,440
because we're a Christian.

771
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,660
Bear in mind,

772
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,360
this suffering

773
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,240
is because we're

774
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,860
a child of God.

775
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,260
Every man has suffering.

776
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,040
This kind of suffering

777
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,000
is what you get

778
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,240
when you believe in Christ.

779
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,420
And the other way

780
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,360
you can get rid of it

781
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,640
is to get rid of Christ.

782
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,780
Then you can lose it.

783
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,600
And that's why

784
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,080
we call it cross-bearing.

785
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,860
But when you and I

786
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,880
shall endure it,

787
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,700
it's the evidence

788
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,240
that Christ

789
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,400
has overruled everything

790
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,660
and what comes,

791
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,500
we can't do it

792
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,180
without bitterness

793
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,400
because we can say

794
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,620
the things that he has

795
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,240
allowed to come

796
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,920
into my life,

797
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,760
they are expanding

798
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,600
my capacity,

799
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,140
my faith grows stronger,

800
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,400
that in heaven

801
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,080
you and I

802
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,760
will be able

803
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
to enjoy

804
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,100
even with a greater

805
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,400
spiritual capacity

806
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,420
the things

807
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,080
which eyes

808
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,980
have not seen

809
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,840
nor ears heard

810
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,740
neither have entered

811
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,100
into the heart of man.

812
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,480
That's what it means.

813
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,680
That's why

814
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
the big fisherman

815
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,340
up Galilee Way

816
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,040
says your Lord

817
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,800
wants you to walk

818
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,420
in his steps.

819
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,480
He wants you to walk

820
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
in his way.

821
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,540
He wants you to endure

822
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,500
suffering as a Christian

823
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,340
the way he did.

824
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,400
It ought to be

825
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,140
the very joy

826
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,820
and the distinction

827
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
of our lives.

828
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,940
And if again

829
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,760
we would determine

830
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,440
that that's what

831
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,100
we're going to do,

832
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,940
that whatever comes

833
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,900
to us as a Christian,

834
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,340
when we love Christ

835
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,140
and we want to walk

836
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,660
in his way

837
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,340
and we want to treat

838
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,920
others the way

839
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,820
Jesus wants us

840
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,420
to treat them

841
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,480
and when the world

842
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,840
laughs and it ridicules

843
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
and it embarrasses us

844
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
that we can accept

845
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
it in all patience

846
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,500
and in all calmness,

847
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
then we ought to pray

848
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,440
God for strength

849
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,340
to do so

850
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,540
and counted a badge

851
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,980
of honor

852
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,620
and a badge

853
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,220
of distinction.

854
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,520
I'll never forget

855
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,080
when in Rome

856
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,600
last summer

857
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
I stood and walked

858
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,620
into the Colosseum.

859
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh, the Colosseum,

860
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
what's it noted for?

861
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,540
Because there is

862
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,460
where Christians

863
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,300
who suffered

864
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,320
because they were

865
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,880
Christians

866
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
who gave their lives

867
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,660
because they believed

868
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,460
in Jesus Christ.

869
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,520
They went to their death

870
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,400
before lions

871
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,780
and they were pulled

872
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,360
to pieces

873
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,380
because there was

874
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,020
no bitterness,

875
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
there was no resentment,

876
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,000
no hatred.

877
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh, the Colosseum,

878
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,940
while stands,

879
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,900
the Colosseum,

880
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,180
remember,

881
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,260
Rome shall stand

882
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,420
and when falls,

883
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,300
the Colosseum,

884
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,180
Rome shall fall

885
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,280
and when Rome falls,

886
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,900
the world.

887
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,160
But the Colosseum stands

888
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,380
as a glorious memorial

889
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,520
to the hundreds

890
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,260
of thousands

891
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,020
of Christians

892
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,340
that gave their lives

893
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,100
with no bitterness.

894
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,520
Why?

895
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,860
Because it was

896
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,000
a badge of honor

897
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,780
and distinction

898
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,260
that they could suffer

899
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,680
and die for their Lord.

900
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,180
There was no spirit

901
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,860
of revenge,

902
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,260
no spirit of getting even.

903
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,440
On the cross,

904
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,840
Jesus,

905
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,460
what did he say

906
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,140
about his enemies?

907
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,160
Father, forgive them.

908
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,900
They don't realize

909
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,500
the enormity

910
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,160
of what they're doing.

911
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,400
I stood outside

912
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,020
the St. Stephen's Gate

913
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,560
in Jerusalem

914
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,480
where they brought Stephen,

915
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,140
the first martyr,

916
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,200
out and they stoned him.

917
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,440
Was there any bitterness,

918
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,220
any resentment

919
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,680
when Stephen was being killed

920
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,700
because he was a Christian?

921
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,720
What did he do?

922
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,140
He prayed,

923
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,440
he said,

924
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:36,760
Lord,

925
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,300
lay not their sin

926
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,320
to their charge.

927
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,340
And he was given

928
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,220
a vision, wasn't he?

929
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,720
He looked up

930
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,940
and he saw Jesus Christ

931
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
stand at the right hand

932
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,420
of God

933
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,320
and again,

934
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,060
it meant something.

935
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,760
It was the thrill

936
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,360
of a lifetime

937
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,180
to walk in the way

938
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,820
of suffering

939
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,180
that God would consider him

940
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,160
to be of that value

941
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,940
and that God would give him

942
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,140
that glorious decision

943
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,640
to make

944
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,500
to again walk in his way

945
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,540
when it meant death.

946
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,980
The great fisherman,

947
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,480
from up Galilee way,

948
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,460
says to you and me

949
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,100
as a Christian,

950
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,700
let's walk in his steps,

951
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,600
let's walk according

952
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,320
to his pattern,

953
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,180
let's endure the suffering

954
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,960
that comes to us

955
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
because we're a child of God

956
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
and let's endure it

957
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,680
with all patience

958
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,880
and with all humility,

959
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,660
no bitterness,

960
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,520
no feeling of getting even.

961
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,340
Why?

962
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,000
Because, listen,

963
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,260
it's that kind of suffering

964
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,320
that Jesus endured

965
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,120
that also brought this about

966
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,540
that he put this whole thing

967
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,160
of judgment

968
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,420
into the hands

969
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,500
of his heavenly Father.

970
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,080
What did he do?

971
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,800
There was no bitterness.

972
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,680
When again those sufferings

973
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,440
came to Jesus,

974
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,300
he simply took this whole thing,

975
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,180
he put it into the hands

976
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,360
of his heavenly Father

977
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
who judges righteously.

978
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,880
Isn't that a marvelous thing?

979
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,200
Why?

980
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,960
Jesus realized

981
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,780
that at the time

982
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,260
that was not the time

983
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,980
for judgment.

984
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,780
This was the time

985
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,520
for grace.

986
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,700
This was the time

987
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,060
when men could still be one

988
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,780
and therefore

989
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,920
this was not the time

990
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,740
for judgment.

991
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,740
And he had no spirit

992
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,380
of revenge.

993
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,200
He simply put it

994
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,780
into the hands

995
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,640
of his heavenly Father

996
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
who judges all things fairly.

997
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,260
But I want to call

998
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,280
your attention to this

999
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,760
that he put judgment

1000
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,520
into the hands

1001
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,480
of his heavenly Father.

1002
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,100
Today, what are we reading?

1003
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,760
We read not long ago

1004
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,600
where somebody says

1005
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
capital punishment

1006
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,800
should be outlawed

1007
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,240
because it's nothing

1008
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,280
but revenge.

1009
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Now, we're not arguing

1010
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
capital punishment

1011
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,480
this morning,

1012
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,440
but the big point

1013
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,200
of that is this.

1014
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,820
any kind of judgment

1015
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,320
is revenge

1016
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,880
according to that statement.

1017
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,220
In other words,

1018
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,140
in Merlin County

1019
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,540
when Judge Paul Smith

1020
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,700
in judgment

1021
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,860
puts again

1022
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,900
a punishment

1023
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,020
on a criminal,

1024
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,620
he is doing it

1025
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,520
in revenge.

1026
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,160
When Judge Ed Rousseau

1027
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,260
in probate court

1028
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,160
brings any kind

1029
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,600
of judgment

1030
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
against an individual,

1031
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,000
then it's got

1032
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
to be revenge

1033
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,500
because it's judgment.

1034
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,060
When Judge Hazen

1035
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,960
brings judgment

1036
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,820
against somebody

1037
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,640
in Merlin City,

1038
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,100
then it's got

1039
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,380
to be revenge

1040
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,340
according to

1041
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,540
what we're being told.

1042
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,080
Do you see

1043
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,500
what's implied in that?

1044
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,460
Don't let anybody

1045
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,400
kid you.

1046
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,420
You see,

1047
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,520
it's like this.

1048
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,840
If all judgment

1049
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,140
is revenge,

1050
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,460
then God surely

1051
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,780
can never enter judgment

1052
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,600
with you and me.

1053
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,720
There can't be any hell

1054
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,820
because that's judgment

1055
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,580
and judgment's revenge.

1056
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,000
God is a God of love.

1057
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,180
Now underneath it all,

1058
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,340
this is the thing.

1059
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,580
Men are trying

1060
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,480
to tell you and me

1061
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,540
there isn't any hell,

1062
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
there isn't any punishment

1063
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,560
for sin,

1064
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,780
there isn't any judgment

1065
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,180
because if there's judgment,

1066
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,640
God has a spirit

1067
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,360
of revenge.

1068
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,220
He's getting even.

1069
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,180
Therefore, again,

1070
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,920
you see what's...

1071
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,120
Don't let anybody

1072
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,220
ever tell you

1073
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,080
that judgment

1074
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,720
is revenge.

1075
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,160
If judgment

1076
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,080
is revenge,

1077
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,820
then there isn't

1078
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,300
such a thing

1079
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,920
as justice.

1080
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,920
When we say

1081
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,120
justice is blind

1082
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
because justice

1083
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,740
is fair,

1084
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,380
we lie.

1085
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,140
There is judgment

1086
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,020
and judgment

1087
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,800
is fair

1088
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,400
and judgment

1089
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,020
in the sight

1090
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,360
of God

1091
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,380
is not revenge.

1092
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,780
Don't you let

1093
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,420
everybody undermine you.

1094
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
That's what the world

1095
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,720
would like

1096
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,340
to get you

1097
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,740
to believe

1098
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,860
that God

1099
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,960
is a jellyfish

1100
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,920
type of a God

1101
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,480
of love

1102
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
and that you

1103
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,960
and I can spurn him

1104
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,860
and slap his son

1105
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,600
Jesus Christ

1106
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,320
in the face

1107
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,960
and you can get by

1108
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,260
with it.

1109
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,640
Well, listen,

1110
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,060
friends,

1111
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,680
you can't get by

1112
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,360
with it.

1113
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,860
When Jesus suffered,

1114
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,580
he put the whole thing

1115
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,280
into the hands

1116
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,760
of God

1117
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,920
who judges wisely.

1118
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,300
There is judgment.

1119
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,300
But because this is

1120
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,200
the day of grace,

1121
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,540
listen,

1122
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,560
it ought to be

1123
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,600
the thrill of a lifetime

1124
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,760
to endure

1125
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,680
without bitterness,

1126
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,860
without complaint,

1127
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,740
without a spiritual revenge,

1128
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,520
that which comes

1129
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,120
to you and me

1130
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,320
because we're a Christian,

1131
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,300
because we believe

1132
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:42,800
in Christ,

1133
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,080
because we want to live

1134
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
the way he wants us to live.

1135
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,860
We want to treat others

1136
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,660
the way he wants us

1137
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,280
to treat them.

1138
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,360
We ought to realize this,

1139
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,740
that it brings us assurance

1140
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,540
and it's a thrilling thing

1141
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,260
to know that

1142
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,320
if ever we're going

1143
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,580
to influence anybody

1144
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,800
for Jesus Christ,

1145
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,220
it's when you and I

1146
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,160
suffer for him

1147
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,900
without bitterness.

1148
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,180
Listen,

1149
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,880
let the world

1150
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
look at a man

1151
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,560
who is willing

1152
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,400
to bear

1153
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,680
any kind of persecution

1154
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,120
for Jesus Christ

1155
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,560
and if there's anything

1156
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,100
that will wake

1157
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,740
a man of the world

1158
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:10,920
up,

1159
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,360
it's that.

1160
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,760
A man of the world

1161
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,600
looks at a Christian

1162
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,260
and he says,

1163
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,420
if that man

1164
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,440
is willing to suffer

1165
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,340
for his faith

1166
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,800
and he's willing

1167
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,260
to do it

1168
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,940
without bitterness

1169
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,880
and no revenge

1170
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,240
and he's not threatening

1171
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,740
to get even,

1172
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,000
there must be something

1173
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,400
to what he believes.

1174
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,520
If that man

1175
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,600
is willing to die

1176
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,040
for what he believes

1177
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,340
about Jesus Christ,

1178
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,940
if there's anything

1179
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,040
that will impress

1180
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,980
a man of the world,

1181
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,620
it's that.

1182
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,380
If that doesn't,

1183
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,100
nothing will,

1184
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,900
you know it.

1185
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,420
Is there any

1186
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,340
thrilling life

1187
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,780
in knowing

1188
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,880
that some way,

1189
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,620
somehow,

1190
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,140
you and I

1191
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,720
in walking

1192
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,560
in the steps

1193
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,340
of suffering,

1194
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,540
in walking

1195
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,440
in the pattern

1196
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,180
that Jesus

1197
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,460
has left for us,

1198
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,340
that if some men

1199
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,360
are ever going

1200
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,640
to be influenced

1201
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,020
for Jesus Christ,

1202
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,600
it will be

1203
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,980
by your walking

1204
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,320
in his paths

1205
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,040
and mine.

1206
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,440
Is there any

1207
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,820
thrill in that

1208
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,700
to know

1209
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,720
that we might

1210
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
save just one soul

1211
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,020
from eternal perdition

1212
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,300
when Jesus said

1213
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,720
it would be better

1214
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,380
for a man

1215
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,180
never to have been born

1216
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,420
than to be lost?

1217
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
How about it?

1218
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
It ought to mean

1219
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,260
then today

1220
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,460
that when the big

1221
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:22,940
fishermen

1222
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,720
tells us

1223
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,780
what Jesus wants,

1224
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,420
we ought to say

1225
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,040
to ourselves

1226
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,740
as we pray

1227
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,540
for strength

1228
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,780
that we want

1229
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,440
to walk

1230
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,760
in his ways

1231
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,740
as Christians

1232
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,180
and we want

1233
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,920
strength

1234
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,800
that when we

1235
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,880
are ridiculed

1236
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,020
and laughed at

1237
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,120
and scoffed at

1238
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,280
and even if

1239
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,980
persecution

1240
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,760
and all its

1241
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,820
deadliness comes

1242
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,420
that we might

1243
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,160
be fit

1244
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,260
to endure it.

1245
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,080
You know,

1246
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,080
sometimes we talk

1247
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,900
about the age

1248
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,640
of persecution.

1249
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,060
Oh yes,

1250
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,980
we think back

1251
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,520
of the first

1252
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:52,920
century,

1253
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,520
but listen,

1254
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,080
Christian historians

1255
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,220
have tried to figure out

1256
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,940
exactly about

1257
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,920
how many Christians

1258
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
from the first

1259
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,080
century up until

1260
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,800
now died

1261
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,620
for their faith.

1262
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,040
Do you realize

1263
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,640
this,

1264
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,940
that they have

1265
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,500
figured out

1266
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,420
that in the last

1267
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,540
30 years,

1268
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,340
think of it,

1269
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,860
in the last

1270
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,560
30 years,

1271
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,100
more Christians

1272
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
have paid

1273
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
with their lives

1274
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,320
than have paid

1275
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,140
with their lives

1276
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,900
from the time

1277
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,460
of Christ

1278
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,700
up until

1279
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,720
30 years ago.

1280
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,280
Do you realize

1281
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,580
that?

1282
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,660
So that,

1283
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:21,960
listen,

1284
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,520
I want you to

1285
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,860
remember that.

1286
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,360
When you talk

1287
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,980
about the age

1288
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,520
of persecution,

1289
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,200
listen bud,

1290
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,680
we're living

1291
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,200
in the age

1292
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,720
of persecution.

1293
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,460
Millions

1294
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,360
have been put

1295
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,720
to death

1296
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,240
behind the

1297
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,700
iron curtain

1298
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,280
for no other

1299
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,760
crime than

1300
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,240
that they believe

1301
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,980
in Jesus Christ.

1302
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,800
There are

1303
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,380
hundreds of

1304
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,760
thousands

1305
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,380
in the salt

1306
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:35,700
mines

1307
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,560
who are slaves

1308
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:36,980
and will be

1309
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,580
slaves to the

1310
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:37,920
end of their

1311
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,460
lives behind

1312
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,080
the iron curtain

1313
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,840
for no other

1314
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,360
reason than

1315
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,840
that they believe

1316
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,560
in Jesus Christ.

1317
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,000
Don't ever

1318
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,600
forget it.

1319
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,240
This is the

1320
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,020
century of

1321
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,580
persecution.

1322
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,080
In the last

1323
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,980
30 years,

1324
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,620
may I say it

1325
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,840
again,

1326
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,420
more Christians

1327
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,280
have died

1328
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,940
and have been

1329
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,800
persecuted for

1330
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,280
their faith

1331
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,460
than have been

1332
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:54,960
since the

1333
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,440
beginning of

1334
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,340
Jesus Christ

1335
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,040
and Christianity

1336
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,740
itself.

1337
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,220
Don't forget

1338
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,760
that.

1339
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,100
Therefore,

1340
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,580
again,

1341
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,680
we ought to

1342
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,240
be ready for

1343
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,360
it.

1344
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,520
Oh,

1345
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,320
it can come.

1346
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,840
Remember when

1347
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,540
I was in Rome,

1348
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,540
I was walking

1349
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:07,980
along and I

1350
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,380
looked up and

1351
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,040
saw a sign

1352
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,660
on the street

1353
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,520
and I was

1354
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,100
taken aback

1355
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,480
and it said

1356
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,060
the Appian

1357
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,460
Way.

1358
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,560
Well,

1359
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,020
you know what

1360
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,560
that brings

1361
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,980
a flood of

1362
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,280
memories.

1363
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,700
We've all

1364
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,180
talked about

1365
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,640
the Appian

1366
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:16,860
Way.

1367
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,360
Those of you

1368
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,620
that have

1369
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,200
studied Latin

1370
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,780
in high school,

1371
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,180
the Appian

1372
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,640
here I was

1373
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,060
on it.

1374
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,220
When I saw

1375
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,660
the sign

1376
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,180
the Appian

1377
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,420
Way,

1378
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:22,920
my mind

1379
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,380
began to

1380
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,720
think of

1381
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,020
something

1382
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,400
that took

1383
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,920
place on

1384
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,400
the Appian

1385
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,580
Way

1386
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,180
according to

1387
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,620
tradition.

1388
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,560
That was

1389
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:27,880
with the

1390
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,440
big fisherman

1391
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,060
himself.

1392
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,080
Remember

1393
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,560
the story

1394
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,040
is told

1395
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,520
in tradition,

1396
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,000
it's not

1397
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,560
in scripture

1398
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,120
but about

1399
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,600
Peter that

1400
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,040
he was in

1401
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,480
Rome and

1402
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,680
Nero,

1403
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:34,960
you know,

1404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,560
had set fire

1405
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,060
to Rome

1406
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,020
and I saw

1407
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,040
Rome burned

1408
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,520
and he blamed

1409
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,900
it on the

1410
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,240
Christians.

1411
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,120
And the

1412
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,760
Apostle Peter

1413
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,440
was told by

1414
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,820
his friends

1415
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,500
to flee the

1416
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,900
city of

1417
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Rome because

1418
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,400
they were

1419
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,980
persecuting

1420
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,220
them and

1421
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,600
putting them

1422
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,060
to death,

1423
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,540
this big

1424
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,920
fisherman.

1425
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,240
He started

1426
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,740
down the

1427
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,340
Appian Way

1428
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,600
and I

1429
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:53,920
thought of

1430
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,340
him that

1431
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,660
day,

1432
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:54,940
the old

1433
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,300
Apostle

1434
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,560
Peter,

1435
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,240
the old

1436
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,680
fisherman

1437
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,160
from up

1438
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,560
Galloway

1439
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,080
going down

1440
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,520
the Appian

1441
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:58,880
Way at

1442
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,140
night,

1443
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,100
fleeing the

1444
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,520
city and

1445
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:00,720
fleeing

1446
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,320
persecution.

1447
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:01,740
The story

1448
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,100
is told

1449
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,400
that as

1450
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,620
he was

1451
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,920
walking

1452
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,280
down,

1453
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,320
suddenly

1454
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,640
there was

1455
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:04,940
somebody

1456
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,280
coming

1457
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,680
towards

1458
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,160
Rome and

1459
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,560
he at

1460
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,080
first couldn't

1461
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,520
distinguish

1462
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:07,760
the

1463
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,340
features but

1464
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:08,760
as the

1465
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,340
person came

1466
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,800
closer,

1467
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:10,980
Peter looked

1468
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,640
at him and

1469
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,920
he suddenly

1470
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,320
recognized him

1471
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,760
and it was

1472
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,380
his Lord.

1473
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,480
And when

1474
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,320
Jesus came

1475
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,820
and passed

1476
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,040
him,

1477
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,760
Peter supposed

1478
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:18,980
to look

1479
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,260
at him and

1480
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,440
he says,

1481
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,260
Quo vodis

1482
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,740
domine,

1483
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,380
whither goest

1484
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,640
thou,

1485
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,140
master?

1486
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,120
And then

1487
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,860
Jesus looked

1488
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,540
at Peter and

1489
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,880
he said,

1490
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,380
I'm going

1491
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,020
to Rome

1492
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,360
to be

1493
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,820
crucified

1494
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,500
again.

1495
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,020
Then the

1496
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,080
old horseman

1497
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,600
himself,

1498
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,060
the big

1499
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,460
fisherman,

1500
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:32,960
he turned

1501
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,300
around,

1502
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,720
he came

1503
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,180
back the

1504
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,500
Appian

1505
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,540
Way and

1506
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,800
he went

1507
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,520
into Rome

1508
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,920
and when

1509
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,300
they were

1510
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,720
ready to

1511
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,040
kill him,

1512
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,320
he said,

1513
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,820
my Lord

1514
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,480
was crucified

1515
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,060
with his

1516
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,520
head up,

1517
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,360
but he

1518
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,540
said,

1519
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,980
I'm not

1520
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,620
worthy to

1521
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,140
die that

1522
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,400
way,

1523
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,220
you crucify

1524
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,640
me with

1525
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,100
my head

1526
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,420
down.

1527
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,000
Tradition

1528
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,720
says then

1529
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,900
that Peter

1530
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,800
the big

1531
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,240
fisherman

1532
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,720
from up

1533
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,420
Galilee Way,

1534
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,800
he was

1535
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,200
crucified

1536
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,780
with his

1537
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,200
feet up

1538
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,420
in the

1539
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:52,720
air and

1540
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,120
his head

1541
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,580
down

1542
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,780
because he

1543
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,140
was the

1544
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,540
one that

1545
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,880
had told

1546
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,400
the Christians

1547
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,760
of his

1548
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,020
day,

1549
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,680
go and

1550
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,580
walk in

1551
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
his ways.

1552
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,460
Yes,

1553
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:00,880
the big

1554
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,300
fisherman,

1555
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,320
he proved

1556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,660
it with

1557
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,340
his life,

1558
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,220
that the

1559
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,840
thrill of our

1560
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,440
life ought

1561
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,140
to be this,

1562
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,340
surely it's

1563
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,180
uncalled for,

1564
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,560
it's unjustified,

1565
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,460
it's undeserved,

1566
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,420
but the

1567
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,980
thrill of being

1568
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,520
a Christian

1569
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,280
ought to be

1570
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,620
this,

1571
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,300
that Christ

1572
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,880
would count

1573
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,260
you and

1574
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,760
me worthy,

1575
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,880
that we

1576
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,660
might suffer

1577
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,400
for him,

1578
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,320
that we

1579
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,860
might have

1580
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,300
within our

1581
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,940
own souls

1582
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,500
the assurance

1583
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,300
that his

1584
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,040
fellowship is

1585
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,480
with us

1586
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:23,900
and that he

1587
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,260
is our

1588
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,700
Christ.

1589
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,400
We

1590
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,800
beautifully

1591
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,260
say it,

1592
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,720
don't we,

1593
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,060
in the

1594
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,440
song,

1595
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,000
my God

1596
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,480
and I

1597
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,900
go in

1598
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,420
the field

1599
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,940
together,

1600
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,340
we walk

1601
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,020
and talk

1602
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,420
as good

1603
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,880
friends

1604
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,300
shouldn't

1605
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,600
do,

1606
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,700
we clasp

1607
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,540
our hands,

1608
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,580
our voices

1609
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,740
ring with

1610
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,340
laughter,

1611
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,960
my God

1612
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,480
and I

1613
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,900
walk

1614
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,280
through the

1615
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,620
meadows,

1616
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,080
you,

1617
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,680
that's the

1618
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,940
great glorious

1619
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,700
feeling that we

1620
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,380
have when we

1621
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,000
are in fellowship

1622
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,520
with him,

1623
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,920
oh my God

1624
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,380
and I,

1625
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,020
oh yes,

1626
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,240
this world

1627
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,140
will pass

1628
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,120
and with it

1629
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,680
come and

1630
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,380
trifles,

1631
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,040
but oh God

1632
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,220
and I go on

1633
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,060
unendingly,

1634
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,440
with his head

1635
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,320
down and his

1636
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,920
feet up from

1637
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,520
the cross,

1638
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,680
the big

1639
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,540
fisherman from

1640
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,300
up Galilee

1641
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,220
way says to

1642
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,620
you and me

1643
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,160
this morning,

1644
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,720
follow in his

1645
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,260
steps,

1646
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,860

1647
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,420
steps,

1648
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,400
amen.

1649
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,720
The peace

1650
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,360
of God

1651
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,160
