1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
The grace be unto you and peace from God our Father ran from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,660
Let us hear the word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,640
as we find it written in the letter of James, the first chapter, the 18th verse.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:32,400
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,880
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,120
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,040
In Christ Jesus, the Christ of Christian mothers, dear friends,

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,120
you who are here in God's house this morning,

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,760
and you also Christian friends who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,720
Today is the second Sunday in May,

11
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:21,140
and it is the Sunday set apart in our country to be observed as Mother's Day.

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,000
Today is the day, therefore, when we honor our mothers.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,020
Some of you, I notice, have the privilege of having your mothers in church with you this morning.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,200
A very happy occasion, is it not?

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,440
Others of you, I know, plan to contact and to visit your mothers sometime during this day.

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,500
Some of you, some of you, some of you, have already sent gifts.

17
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,980
Others of you will contact mothers at a distance by means of the telephone.

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,080
And still others of us have on this Mother's Day, mothers of memory,

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,540
mothers who have been called from this world and who have entered the kingdom triumphant.

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,040
Christian mothers, I'd like to challenge you this morning.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,940
I would like to challenge you and ask you this morning at this service

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,260
to take a look at your Christian children as God sees them.

23
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,500
Would you like to do that?

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,440
I would like to have you see your Christian children through the eyes of God.

25
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,380
That is my challenge to you today.

26
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,240
And you may say, well, how does God look at our Christian children?

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,200
And we find the answer in the Word of God in our text this morning

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,240
where we find James, the brother of the Lord,

29
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,280
telling this, that God of his own will begat us

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,180
or made us his sons or his children through the word of truth

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,040
that we might become or that we might be

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,800
a kind of first fruits of his creation or of his creatures.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,120
God looks at your Christian children as a kind of first fruits of his creatures,

34
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,400
as a sort of first fruits.

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,020
And you may say, well, what does that mean?

36
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,120
To understand that, Christian mothers,

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,860
we've got to take a look at the Jewish harvest festival for a moment

38
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,060
and to realize what it meant when the harvest time came for the Jew,

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
when he cut the first wheat or the first grain of the field,

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
there was a great religious ceremony

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,500
because the first grain that was cut belonged to the Lord

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,220
and he presented it to God

43
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,000
because God looked upon the first fruits of the field

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
as being of a special sacredness to him,

45
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,020
of being something that meant more to him than all the rest.

46
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,120
It was something especially sacred

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,600
and something especially pure and good to him.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,620
And in the same way, the first fruits applied to the womb,

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,720
the firstborn son.

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,720
Oh, the firstborn son was something special to God.

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,900
And therefore, as the first fruits of the womb,

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,980
God looked upon the first fruits, therefore,

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,060
as being of a special sacredness,

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,820
of a special value,

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,540
of being the very apple of his eye.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,160
And therefore, I challenge you, Christian mothers, this morning,

57
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,700
would you look at your Christian children through the eyes of God

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,800
and see them as something special,

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,440
as being specially sacred,

60
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,200
of being of special, uncommon importance to God,

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,420
that they are especially near and precious to God,

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,180
the very apple of his eye?

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,640
Will you see your children as God sees them?

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,800
And yet you may say to me on this Mother's Day,

65
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,860
well, it's hard to believe

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,400
that my Christian children are the apple of God's eye,

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,800
that they are something really special,

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
that they are something really precious to him,

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,500
that they are really sacred to him

70
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,140
as the first fruits of the field,

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,360
that my children mean that much to God,

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,040
that they occupy that kind of an exalted position,

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,640
that they occupy that kind of status in the eyes of God.

74
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,040
You may say to me this morning,

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,760
well, that's a little bit too good to be true,

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,820
because you may say in all humility,

77
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,360
nothing extraordinary, nothing uncommon,

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,060
nothing spectacular has ever happened to my Christian children.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
And yet may I say to you this morning,

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,520
as I challenge you to look at your Christian children

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,900
through the eyes of God

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,240
and see them as a kind of first fruits,

83
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,620
as a sort of first fruits,

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,660
something especially sacred,

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,160
something especially precious to God,

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,220
the apple of his eye,

87
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,040
for this reason that it is too good,

88
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,680
but it is too true,

89
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,080
because something extraordinary

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,060
has happened to your children.

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Would to God that what has happened

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,280
to your Christian children

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,500
would have happened to all children.

94
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,340
God would like to have it happen to all.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,060
But it has happened to your children,

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,880
Christian mothers,

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
to your Christian children.

98
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,080
And may I mention in the first place,

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,060
this is something extraordinary and uncommon

100
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,840
that has happened to your Christian children.

101
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,860
And God reminds you of this,

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,640
that your Christian children have been born again.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,260
Oh, they were born once physically.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,060
And oh, you Christian mothers,

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,200
you'll never forget that occasion, will you?

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,980
When you held for the first time in your arms,

107
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,760
your child,

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,700
especially the firstborn.

109
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,200
When you realized that unselfishly

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,880
you were willing to face death

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,540
so that you might become a mother,

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,980
and when you held that child in your arms

113
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,800
and you kissed the child behind the ear

114
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,440
and it smelt like narcissus and lotus blossoms,

115
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,740
oh, you thank God, didn't you,

116
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,460
that you had become a mother.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
And yet, as a Christian mother,

118
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,120
you realized something that day.

119
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,960
You knew that it was a marvelous thing

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,320
that you were able to be the mother of a child

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,060
to be born, humanly speaking,

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,060
but you knew that your child

123
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
was born in a condition of sin.

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,640
You knew that it was subject to death

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
and because it came into the world

126
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,400
with the taint of original sin,

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,860
as all of us do,

128
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,620
as the Word of God declares.

129
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,560
And therefore, you knew this,

130
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,400
that Jesus says,

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,540
except a man be born of water

132
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,520
and of the Spirit,

133
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,220
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God

134
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,480
because that which is born of the flesh is flesh,

135
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,920
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

136
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,340
You, as a Christian mother, knew this,

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
that there was another birth

138
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
that was necessary for your child,

139
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,560
and that was the spiritual birth in baptism.

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,440
And so you asked the question,

141
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,640
when is the next baptism, didn't you?

142
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,160
And then you and your husband,

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,640
you presented your child

144
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,540
to the Lord Jesus in baptism.

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,860
And in baptismal regeneration,

146
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,600
your child was born a second time.

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,320
And there was something marvelous

148
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
that took place in that moment

149
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
when the Holy Spirit,

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,980
by means of the Word of God and water,

151
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,340
came to your child.

152
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,900
There was kindled in the heart of your child

153
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,340
a living faith in Jesus Christ

154
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,400
as Lord and Savior.

155
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,960
Oh, it was not a conscious faith

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,500
that your child realized

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
what had taken place,

158
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,000
but Jesus Christ placed in that heart

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
a faith in Him.

160
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,360
And there came with that faith

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,740
then every blessing of the gospel,

162
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
every blessing that Christ Jesus

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
brought into the world

164
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
by His sufferings and death on Calvary.

165
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,640
It's a marvelous example

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,220
of the grace of God, isn't it,

167
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,560
that a child does nothing

168
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,860
but when the child is born again in baptism

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,660
because Christ Jesus went to the cross

170
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,580
and bore the guilt

171
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,160
and the punishment of the world's sin,

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,240
there is given to every child in baptism

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,920
the forgiveness of the taint of original sin.

174
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,740
There is given to that child

175
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,420
the forgiveness of eternal death and damnation.

176
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,880
And there is given to every child in baptism

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,440
eternal life and everlasting salvation.

178
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,340
Mother, something extraordinary

179
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,920
has happened to your Christian children.

180
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,020
They were born a second time in baptism.

181
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
They came to a living faith in Jesus Christ

182
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,060
and they were made joint heirs

183
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,480
with Him of eternal life.

184
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,620
And therefore, when you realize

185
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,500
that that's the extraordinary thing

186
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,120
that has happened

187
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,820
and, oh, God is no respecter of persons

188
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,220
and God doesn't love one child more than another,

189
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,900
but it is God's will

190
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,920
that all children might have Christian mothers

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,940
and that Christian mothers

192
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,600
might present them to Him

193
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,900
and that they might be born again

194
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,140
so that God could look at all children

195
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,640
and say,

196
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,700
they are the sort of firstfruits.

197
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,480
They are special.

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
They are something especially precious.

199
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,660
They are something especially dear and near to Him.

200
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,840
They are the apple of His eye.

201
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,420
And today I would challenge you, Christian mothers,

202
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,520
will you continue to look at your children,

203
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,800
your Christian children,

204
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,560
through the eyes of God?

205
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,000
And as you live each day with them,

206
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
will you say to yourselves,

207
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,020
my Christian children,

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
they are a sort of firstfruits.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,840
They are especially dear and precious to God.

210
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,320
Something extraordinary has happened to them.

211
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,880
And if you do that,

212
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
I can assure you this,

213
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,020
you're going to thank God

214
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,860
for the privilege of being a mother.

215
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,520
Oh, there are some mothers

216
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,540
that resent being a mother.

217
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,780
Maybe some of you would say,

218
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I must confess that when I was carrying

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,880
this child of mine under my heart,

220
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
that there were times when I was selfish

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
and I wished that I were not going to be a mother.

222
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,260
You may have confessed again

223
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,040
to say I deeply regretted

224
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,000
and I even didn't want the child.

225
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,060
And again, I murmured and complained against God.

226
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,760
But oh, you Christian mothers,

227
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,960
you can say that God has long ago forgiven me

228
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
for such emotional things

229
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,560
that I thought in the days

230
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,500
when I was carrying beneath my own heart,

231
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
my unborn child.

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,300
But how many of you, again,

233
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,500
when you look at your child

234
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,620
and say, think of it,

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,040
my child is a sort of a firstfruits of God.

236
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Something special,

237
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,000
something precious,

238
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,300
the apple of his eye.

239
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,060
What a privilege

240
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,100
to be a mother.

241
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,920
You know, this morning,

242
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,880
my heart aches for a certain mother.

243
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,120
She's on her honeymoon

244
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,960
down in South America.

245
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,000
She's an heiress.

246
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,240
She inherited four million dollars.

247
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,000
She turned her back on a husband.

248
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,080
And that a person might do

249
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,720
if husband and wife can't get along.

250
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,900
They might separate.

251
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Mind you, I didn't say divorce.

252
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,540
But this mother that I'm thinking about

253
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,260
this morning,

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,060
for whom my heart aches,

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,500
she turned her back on four children,

256
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
the oldest of which is only twelve.

257
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,140
And she married a man 17 years her senior.

258
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,060
This is Mother's Day.

259
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,280
And I can't help but think of her this morning.

260
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
I wonder now that the bloom

261
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,840
and the enthusiasm

262
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
of some of the honeymoon is worn over.

263
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,980
I wonder how she feels

264
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,760
when she could turn her back

265
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,800
on four children

266
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,220
that she brought into this world

267
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,820
and would give them up

268
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,900
for someone who should not be her husband.

269
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,800
I wonder what she will say someday

270
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
when those four children look at her

271
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,540
and say,

272
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,880
you didn't love us enough

273
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,220
that you cared to rear us,

274
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,320
you gave us away.

275
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,540
And this mother has aspirations

276
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,880
for the White House.

277
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,280
When you and I look at the White House today

278
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,720
and we see a Jackie Kennedy,

279
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,460
we are proud of motherhood, aren't we?

280
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,680
And I feel certain

281
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,260
that if this nation ever has to choose,

282
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
it will choose a Jackie

283
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,660
rather than a happy

284
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,180
to be in the White House.

285
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,700
My heart aches for her

286
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,480
for any mother

287
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
that could give up her children

288
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,320
for her own selfish happiness.

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,040
I challenge you, Christian mothers,

290
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,280
that if you can look at your children

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,380
through the eyes of God

292
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,880
and you can see them

293
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,940
as sort of a firstfruits of God's creature,

294
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,060
something special to God,

295
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,380
and listen,

296
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,280
you'll be proud of motherhood

297
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,360
and if they should ever turn away from you,

298
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,380
yours will be the satisfaction

299
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,820
that at least you did your best.

300
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,160
Oh, you may be a stepmother,

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,240
you may be a foster mother,

302
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
or you may be a grandmother

303
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,560
who has taken the place of a mother,

304
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,880
and your efforts may not be appreciated,

305
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,280
but if you have looked at those children

306
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,920
through the eyes of God

307
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,840
and you have seen them

308
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,100
as God has seen them

309
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,080
as being a kind of firstfruits,

310
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,460
the apple of his eye,

311
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,680
you may have no regrets,

312
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,460
even though again

313
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,940
they would turn against you.

314
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,120
I challenge you, Christian mothers,

315
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,980
this morning,

316
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,800
on this Mother's Day,

317
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,820
that you would say,

318
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,400
I will look at my children,

319
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
my Christian children.

320
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,640
I will try to see them

321
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,780
with the eyes of God,

322
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,040
to see them as God sees them,

323
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,660
and God sees them

324
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,040
as sort of a firstfruits.

325
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh, they are something special.

326
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,700
They are his prized possession.

327
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,580
They are sacred to him.

328
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,040
They mean the apple of his eye

329
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,120
because something spectacular

330
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,020
has happened to your Christian children.

331
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,320
Not only this,

332
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,980
that they have been born again,

333
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,520
but God would remind you and me,

334
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,580
your Christian mothers,

335
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,060
especially in the second place,

336
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,960
that your children

337
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,920
have had the Holy Spirit

338
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,420
come and abide in their hearts.

339
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,360
You know,

340
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,640
something spectacular

341
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,800
also happened on the day

342
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,360
when you Christian mothers

343
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,320
presented your children for baptism.

344
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,900
When faith in Jesus Christ

345
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,840
was engendered

346
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
in the heart of your child,

347
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,860
the Holy Spirit

348
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,700
moved in too.

349
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,240
The Word of God says,

350
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,660
Know ye not that ye are

351
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,620
the temples of God,

352
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,340
and that the Spirit of God

353
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,500
dwells within you?

354
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,260
Christian mothers,

355
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,880
do you know

356
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,900
that your children's bodies

357
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,960
are the temples

358
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,360
of the living God?

359
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,380
And you and I

360
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,080
may stand with our mouths open

361
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,620
and we may say,

362
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,400
How can it be

363
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,720
that God could dwell?

364
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,740
He personally,

365
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,480
the Holy Spirit,

366
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,140
in the heart

367
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,540
and in the very soul

368
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,420
of all individuals

369
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,620
who have been baptized.

370
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,520
Well, you see,

371
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,500
the nature of gamut,

372
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,340
we make our God so small

373
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,300
that we fail to understand

374
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,340
His magnitude

375
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,260
and His bigness.

376
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,680
But James says,

377
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,400
He is the Father of lights,

378
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,660
the God who by the fiat

379
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
of His Word

380
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,080
brought into existence lights

381
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,380
the suns and the moons

382
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,420
and the stars.

383
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,860
He is that God

384
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,900
and that Holy Spirit

385
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,120
dwells in the heart

386
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,680
of your children by faith.

387
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,600
Oh, sometimes,

388
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
oh, there have been days,

389
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,640
haven't there,

390
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,380
when you'd say,

391
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,760
and my children

392
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
have the Holy Spirit

393
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
dwelling within them.

394
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,780
Oh, you've seen

395
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,080
the trying days, haven't you?

396
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,540
And you finally

397
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,460
got them to sleep.

398
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,140
But didn't you ever

399
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,280
walk into the room

400
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,860
at night

401
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,580
and when the moonbeams

402
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,800
were shining in the room

403
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,880
you looked at the face

404
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,100
of a tussled little boy

405
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,240
and you rubbed

406
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,120
his hair back

407
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,580
and you looked

408
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,480
into his face

409
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,540
and you saw

410
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,720
the image of God,

411
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,460
didn't you?

412
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,440
And you thanked God

413
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,100
and you thought,

414
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,820
my, God is oozing out.

415
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,940
God is there.

416
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,860
You saw it.

417
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Oh, Tommy lad,

418
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,600
Tommy lad,

419
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,220
though you're scarce

420
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,240
the way you're owed,

421
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,900
you've seen the image

422
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,040
of God, haven't you?

423
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,900
Something spectacular

424
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,600
happened in baptism

425
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,320
and that Holy Spirit

426
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,640
that dwells in the hearts

427
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,400
of your children

428
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,280
by faith,

429
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,540
that Holy Spirit

430
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
would guide them

431
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,860
into all truth

432
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,020
so that living

433
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,980
in the ways of God

434
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,000
they should not lose

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,040
eternal life.

436
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,160
That's what the Holy Spirit

437
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,780
is doing in their hearts

438
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,560
by faith

439
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,380
lest they would lose

440
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,440
the great blessings

441
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,820
that became theirs

442
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,620
when they were born again

443
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,340
by water and of the Spirit.

444
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,760
and that's why

445
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,460
this morning

446
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,400
Christian mothers

447
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,720
I challenge you

448
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,080
will you look

449
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,060
at your children,

450
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,340
your Christian children

451
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,680
through the eyes of God

452
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,160
and every day

453
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,840
that you live

454
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,600
when you look at them

455
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,080
will you say

456
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,740
why they are

457
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,160
a sort of a first fruits.

458
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,680
They are something

459
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,300
special to God.

460
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,580
My children

461
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,520
as Christians

462
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,940
they're sacred,

463
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,780
they're precious.

464
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,660
Oh, they're so dear

465
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,220
to God

466
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,900
they're the apple

467
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,760
of his eye.

468
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,960
And if you can look

469
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,900
at them like that

470
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,380
every day

471
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,240
and I challenge you

472
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,920
to do so

473
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,180
then you're going

474
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,400
to play your role

475
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,580
as Christian mother

476
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,300
with dignity.

477
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,320
Oh, what a role

478
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,240
you may say

479
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,040
just a Christian mother.

480
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Is that it?

481
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,480
Just a Christian mother?

482
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,660
Do you know

483
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,680
of any role

484
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,200
do you know

485
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,080
of any career

486
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,180
that is comparable

487
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,980
with taking

488
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
a child

489
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,860
that belongs

490
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,740
to God

491
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,780
the first fruits

492
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,920
of all his creatures

493
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,480
a sort of

494
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,000
a special blessing

495
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
especially sacred

496
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
and especially

497
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,480
near to God

498
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,820
and training

499
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,260
that child

500
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,160
in the word

501
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,720
of God.

502
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,220
Do you know

503
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,920
of anything

504
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,560
that could tax

505
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,140
anyone

506
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,280
any greater than that?

507
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,240
You are

508
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
the greatest teacher

509
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,100
that your child

510
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,260
will ever have.

511
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,260
Whether you're going

512
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,300
to be the best teacher

513
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,420
or not, I don't know

514
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,260
but you're the greatest

515
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,120
because you're there first

516
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,680
and what you teach

517
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,300
your child

518
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,900
your child

519
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,940
will never forget

520
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,720
and whatever you tell

521
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,360
your child

522
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,080
your child

523
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,940
will believe it

524
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,860
because you

525
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,460
his mother said so.

526
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,360
And what have you done

527
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,520
as Christian mothers?

528
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,360
Oh, you've played

529
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
your role well.

530
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,700
You taught your children

531
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,600
how to pray

532
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,740
that they might feel

533
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,300
the nearness

534
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,580
of God with them

535
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,740
and you taught them

536
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,460
the word of God

537
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,120
and you brought them

538
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,880
to Sunday school

539
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,640
and you brought them

540
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
to church early in life

541
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
that they might

542
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,180
realize and know

543
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,760
what it means

544
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,880
to worship God

545
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,260
to hear the word

546
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,120
of God

547
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,600
and to allow

548
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,920
that word of God

549
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
to sow itself

550
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,780
within their own hearts

551
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,160
because

552
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,520
this is the temple

553
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,400
of God

554
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,300
to come in

555
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,760
to worship.

556
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,020
Last summer

557
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,420
it was my privilege

558
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,760
to be in Scotland

559
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,800
on Sunday.

560
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,580
We were in Glasgow

561
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,520
and when Sunday came

562
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,220
I wanted to go

563
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,320
to a Scotch Presbyterian church

564
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,540
and I looked up

565
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,320
the largest one

566
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
I could find

567
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,800
and we worshipped

568
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,820
there that morning.

569
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,380
The minister's name

570
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,600
was Reverend Bob Allen.

571
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,420
It was quite an experience

572
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,480
because I saw

573
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
an old ritual

574
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,100
that is carried out

575
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,200
in the Scotch Presbyterian church.

576
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,160
Carried out every Sunday.

577
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,400
The pulpit is rather high.

578
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,740
Besides the minister

579
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,340
and the chancellor

580
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,100
they have a man

581
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,160
who is called a beetle

582
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,040
which means a man

583
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,660
of secondary importance

584
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,620
as regards offices

585
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,480
in the church.

586
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,180
But when it came time

587
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,120
that Sunday morning

588
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,560
for the sermon

589
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,660
and the pulpit

590
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,560
rather high

591
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,100
the man called the beetle

592
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
got up from his place

593
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,640
he walked over

594
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,700
to a platform

595
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,860
and he picked up

596
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,700
the Bible

597
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,340
and he held it

598
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,600
very reverently

599
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
and carefully

600
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,420
and he climbed

601
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,060
the stairs

602
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,180
into the pulpit

603
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,400
and he opened

604
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,960
the Bible

605
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,420
and he laid it

606
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,740
in the pulpit

607
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,980
and then the beetle

608
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,320
turned this man

609
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,900
and he walked

610
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
down the stairs

611
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,580
and he walked over

612
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,700
to where the minister

613
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,420
was seated

614
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,840
and he motioned

615
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,920
for him to stand

616
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,140
and he took the minister

617
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,240
by the arm

618
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,100
and he brought him back

619
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,860
and brought him

620
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,780
up the stairs

621
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,440
and brought him

622
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,340
into the pulpit

623
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,380
and stood him

624
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,340
in front of the word

625
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,900
of God

626
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,600
and then the beetle

627
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,220
gentleman

628
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,900
walked down the stairs

629
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,440
and took his place.

630
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,480
It's an ancient ritual

631
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,120
in the Scotch

632
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,560
Presbyterian church

633
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,600
and it has

634
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,640
a beautiful meaning

635
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
and the meaning

636
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
is simply this

637
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,780
first the word

638
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,500
of God

639
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,120
is placed

640
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,860
in the pulpit

641
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
and then comes

642
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,320
the minister

643
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
reminding him

644
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,820
that as he stands

645
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,640
in the pulpit

646
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,280
he is expected

647
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
to declare

648
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,640
the word of God

649
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,900
and only

650
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,480
the word of God.

651
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,460
You Christian mothers

652
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,620
play your role

653
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,240
well

654
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,540
you bring

655
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,400
your children

656
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,780
to God's house

657
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,700
that they might

658
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,040
here meet God

659
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,920
and through

660
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,000
the human clay

661
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,860
of a minister

662
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,980
that they might

663
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,200
confront him

664
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,320
and know

665
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,200
his nearness

666
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,460
that yours

667
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,080
may be

668
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,440
this satisfaction

669
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,600
that even

670
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,560
if sometime

671
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
in life

672
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,380
your children

673
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,300
may turn away

674
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,040
from God

675
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,580
there may be

676
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,340
something

677
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,560
left there

678
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,280
that you

679
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
gave them

680
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,640
that will

681
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,160
bring them

682
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,660
back.

683
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,060
I think

684
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,660
in my own

685
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,060
life

686
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,740
of a professor

687
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,480
I had

688
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,100
in one of my

689
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,140
courses in college

690
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,940
he was a very

691
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,980
brilliant man

692
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,720
his attitude

693
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,980
in the classroom

694
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,820
was anything

695
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,480
but what you

696
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,200
would want

697
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,440
but it was

698
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,920
out of the

699
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,360
classroom

700
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,040
and he would

701
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,760
speak vehemently

702
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,460
and with

703
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,220
blasphemy

704
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,920
against the

705
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,700
word of God

706
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
and he ridiculed

707
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,080
it

708
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,020
and it was

709
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,700
beneath the

710
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,400
dignity of an

711
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,740
educated man

712
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,020
and yet the

713
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,940
man came

714
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,540
from a

715
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,600
Christian home

716
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,900
but later

717
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,700
in life

718
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,440
in meeting

719
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,360
that same

720
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,940
professor

721
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,120
it was a

722
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,220
joy to know

723
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,080
that something

724
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,700
that a

725
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,780
Christian mother

726
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,900
had implanted

727
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,800
in his heart

728
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,520
brought about

729
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200
a change

730
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,700
oh yes

731
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,160
he was a

732
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
PhD from

733
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,680
the University

734
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,320
of Chicago

735
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,260
but he came

736
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,960
back to a

737
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,980
living faith

738
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,700
in Jesus

739
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,420
Christ

740
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,120
and it was

741
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
all because

742
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,600
he had had

743
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,040
a Christian

744
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,440
mother

745
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
who had

746
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,180
inculcated

747
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,980
in him

748
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,500
the word

749
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,180
of truth

750
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,440
and he

751
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,960
realized

752
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,380
that he

753
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:30,940
had spoken

754
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,320
out of

755
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,640
turn

756
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
and he

757
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,520
came back

758
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,880
to a

759
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
living faith

760
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,440
oh you

761
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,940
Christian

762
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,300
mothers

763
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,380
I challenge

764
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,160
you this

765
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,660
Sunday

766
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,520
on Mother's

767
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,820
Day

768
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,520
that you

769
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,120
might say

770
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,500
I'm going

771
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:43,900
to see

772
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,540
my Christian

773
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:44,940
children

774
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,640
through the

775
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,220
eyes of

776
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,640
God

777
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,440
and I'm

778
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,800
going to

779
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,200
see them

780
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,520
as a

781
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,880
sort of

782
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,300
a first

783
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,560
fruit

784
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,000
something

785
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,640
special

786
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,460
something

787
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,900
really

788
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,560
uncommon

789
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,160
his

790
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,740
property

791
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,220
and his

792
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,720
possession

793
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
most sacred

794
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,420
the apple

795
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,780
of his

796
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,340
eyes

797
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,760
and you

798
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,400
ought to be

799
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,940
able to

800
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,360
see that

801
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,860
it isn't

802
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,280
too good

803
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,780
to be true

804
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,540
because something

805
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,100
extraordinary

806
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,660
has happened

807
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,040
to your

808
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,440
Christian

809
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:04,840
children

810
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,600
not only

811
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:05,900
have they

812
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,400
been born

813
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,880
again

814
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
not only

815
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,420
has the

816
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,920
Holy Spirit

817
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
come to dwell

818
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,020
in their

819
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,280
hearts

820
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
by faith

821
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,740
but also

822
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,300
God would

823
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,980
remind you

824
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,400
Christian

825
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,740
mothers

826
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,180
this

827
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,820
that God

828
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,640
has taken

829
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,360
your Christian

830
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,880
children

831
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,480
under his

832
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,040
wings

833
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,980
remember when

834
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,720
Jesus cried

835
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,400
over Jerusalem

836
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,040
and he said

837
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,760
oh Jerusalem

838
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,340
Jerusalem

839
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,520
how often

840
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,020
would I have

841
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,660
gathered thy

842
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,460
children together

843
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,180
even as a

844
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,780
hen gathered

845
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,380
her chickens

846
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,120
under her

847
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,780
wings

848
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,200
you and I

849
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,760
have seen

850
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,360
the side

851
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,900
of the hen

852
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,620
with the chickens

853
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,480
under her wings

854
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,240
it's a beautiful

855
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,140
thing isn't it

856
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,120
and God

857
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,640
Almighty

858
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,420
the God

859
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:40,960
of lights

860
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,420

861
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,820

862
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,360
variableness

863
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,020
nor shadow

864
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,480
of turning

865
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,540
the God

866
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,200
who by the

867
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,920
magnificence

868

869
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,760
power of his

870
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,320
word brought

871
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,820
a universe

872
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,660

when baptism

876
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,360
your children

who sees

885
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,080
that nothing

886
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,740
shall happen

887
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,200
to them

888
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,860
beyond his

889
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,380
power

890
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,400

permission

895
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,560
the God

896
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,240
who promises

so that he

901
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,860

904
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,100

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,520
the plan

910
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,240
and the mission

911
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,900
which God

912
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,620
has intended

913
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,100
for them

914
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,460
in giving

915
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,140
them life

916
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,760
oh something

917
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,660

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,300
yes they

923
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,900
have been

924
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,760
endowed

925
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,200
with an

926
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,040
immortality

927
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,460
in this

928
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,900
world

929
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,300
to fulfill

930
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,740
a mission

931
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,520
God has

932
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,220
provided them

933
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,800
with talents

934
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,420
and abilities

935
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,600
and God

936
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,280
has assured

937
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,960
you that

938
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,560
when they

939
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,340
shall fulfill

940
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,020
that mission

941
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,640
for which he

942
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,000
gave them

943
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,400
life

944
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,640
they shall

945
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,540
complete it

946
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,220
to his honor

947
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,800
and glory

948
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,160
and therefore

949
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,280
because it's

950
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,740
too good

951
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,360
and it is

952
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,660
true

953
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,160
something

954
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,140
wondrously

955
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,080
has happened

956
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,820
something

957
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,680
extraordinary

958
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
something uncommon

959
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,480
has happened

960
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,240
to your children

961
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,920
therefore on this

962
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,420
Mother's Day

963
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,400
I challenge you

964
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,440
will you continue

965
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
to see your

966
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,300
Christian children

967
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,680
through the eyes

968
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,320
of God

969
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,900
and look at

970
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,700
them and say

971
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,760
why they're

972
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,280
a sort of

973
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,920
first fruits

974
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
they're something

975
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,780
special

976
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,300
they're especially

977
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,920
precious

978
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,660
they are especially

979
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,060
dear and near

980
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,880
to God

981
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,540
they mean

982
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:19,940
something

983
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,640
they're the apple

984
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,320
of his eye

985
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,260
just like the

986
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,900
first fruits of

987
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,440
the field

988
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,760
and the first

989
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,640
fruits of the womb

990
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,240
and I challenge

991
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,960
you if you look

992
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,940
at them like that

993
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,220
then early in life

994
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,680
you're going to

995
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,600
light the spark

996
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
in their lives

997
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,620
so that they

998
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,240
can fulfill

999
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,780
the plan

1000
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,400
for which God

1001
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,980
has given them

1002
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,400
life

1003
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,940
oh for children

1004
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,480
to have

1005
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,300
Christian mothers

1006
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,440
who will say

1007
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,380
Tommy lad

1008
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,960
or genie

1009
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,260
what are you

1010
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,760
going to be

1011
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,100
what are you

1012
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,400
going to do

1013
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,180
with your life

1014
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,320
how are you

1015
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,280
going to live it

1016
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,880
do you realize

1017
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,560
that there's a

1018
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,180
reason for you

1019
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,760
to be alive

1020
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,140
what are you

1021
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,820
going to do

1022
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,880
how are you

1023
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,500
going to spend

1024
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,280
your days

1025
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,960
to show your

1026
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,900
love for God

1027
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,940
how are you

1028
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,520
going to live it

1029
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,200
with your talents

1030
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,840
and abilities

1031
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,220
that you can

1032
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,140
in this world

1033
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,800
leave it a little

1034
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,220
better

1035
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,140
that you can

1036
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,040
impress people

1037
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,600
that you are

1038
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,240
living out of

1039
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,980
love for God

1040
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,780
and make it easier

1041
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,580
for someone else

1042
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,340
to love your

1043
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,880
Christ

1044
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,520
oh I think

1045
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,060
back

1046
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,380
about 11 years

1047
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,280
ago when I

1048
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,100
stood at my

1049
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,700
own mother's

1050
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,160
grave

1051
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,660
and I think

1052
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,240
back to the

1053
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,820
days when I

1054
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,640
was a child

1055
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,860
my mother

1056
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,180
lit the spark

1057
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,100
rather early

1058
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,840
in life

1059
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,620
to her there

1060
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,280
was nothing

1061
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,820
like the

1062
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,720
Christian ministry

1063
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,220
no one

1064
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,080
ever said

1065
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,940
one word

1066
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,640
against the

1067
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,580
Christian ministry

1068
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,120
as regards

1069
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,680
my mother

1070
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,580
oh she was

1071
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,200
not highly

1072
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,880
educated

1073
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,180
she had just

1074
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,800
finished the

1075
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,420
eighth grade

1076
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,100
high school

1077
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,040
was beyond

1078
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
the reach

1079
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,460
of many

1080
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,020
in those

1081
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,580
days

1082
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,020
but to my

1083
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,840
mother to be

1084
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,580
a minister of

1085
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,420
Jesus Christ

1086
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,700
meant far more

1087
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,800
than to be

1088
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,620
president of

1089
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,140
the United

1090
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,900
States

1091
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,460
but it was

1092
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,360
lighted early

1093
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,160
not only in

1094
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,860
my own heart

1095
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,420
but in my

1096
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,900
brother's

1097
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,200
so it

1098
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,700
wasn't a

1099
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,000
forced

1100
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,440
thing

1101
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
but again

1102
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,220
this thing

1103
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,960
can you

1104
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,660
give your

1105
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,160
life

1106
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,060
in the

1107
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,660
service of

1108
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Jesus Christ

1109
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,460
just about

1110
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,080
11 years

1111
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,740
ago the

1112
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,260
four of us

1113
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,860
children we

1114
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,460
stood at my

1115
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,240
mother's grave

1116
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,660
over in

1117
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,540
Hammond Indiana

1118
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,500
and Oak Hill

1119
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,220
Cemetery

1120
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,760
right near

1121
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,620
South Chicago

1122
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,160
where she

1123
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,860
grew up

1124
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,160
and spent

1125
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,840
most of the

1126
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,380
years of her

1127
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,000
life there

1128
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,560
in East

1129
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,120
St. Louis

1130
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,340
and I

1131
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,260
remember as

1132
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,720
we four

1133
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,500
children stood

1134
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,840
at her

1135
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,360
grave

1136
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,260
and my

1137
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,800
father's

1138
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,140
grave

1139
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,100
alongside of

1140
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,520
hers

1141
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,020
there was

1142
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,200
a sense

1143
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,020
of gratitude

1144
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,760
that we

1145
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,740
four children

1146
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,380
felt

1147
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,520
and that

1148
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,060
was that

1149
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,780
they didn't

1150
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,340
leave us

1151
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,880
too much

1152
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,620
as regards

1153
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,500
earthly things

1154
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,100
because they

1155
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,660
didn't have

1156
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:45,980
it

1157
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,260
but all

1158
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,900
four of us

1159
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,600
could stand

1160
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,940
at the

1161
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,460
grave and

1162
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,900
say but

1163
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,420
mother and

1164
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,920
dad did

1165
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,300
leave us

1166
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:51,680
this

1167
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
they left

1168
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,400
us a

1169
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,840
Christian

1170
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,500
faith

1171
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,860
because we

1172
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,460
are children

1173
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,160
of God

1174
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,140
and they

1175
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,840
left us

1176
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,440
a heritage

1177
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,200
that even

1178
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,080
time cannot

1179
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,680
erase

1180
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,860
and I

1181
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,440
remember there

1182
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,380
also came

1183
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,560
this feeling

1184
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,240
in her grave

1185
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,960
that day

1186
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,160
that I

1187
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,800
had no

1188
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,520
regrets

1189
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,840
you know

1190
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,340
there's one

1191
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,960
thing that a

1192
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,660
Christian mother

1193
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,280
wants more

1194
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,860
than ever in

1195
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,280
life

1196
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,380
she wants

1197
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,140
to be loved

1198
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,540
by her

1199
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,040
children

1200
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,200
she wants

1201
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,560
to be

1202
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,140
wanted

1203
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,880
she doesn't

1204
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,440
want to

1205
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,200
feel like

1206
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,720
a fifth

1207
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,220
wheel

1208
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,700
like she's

1209
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,020
in the

1210
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,440
way

1211
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,720
she wants

1212
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,280
to have

1213
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
her children

1214
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,980
rise up

1215
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,280
and call

1216
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,920
her blessed

1217
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,800
isn't that it

1218
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,660
Christian mothers

1219
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,540
I could stand

1220
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:36,900
at my

1221
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,680
mother's grave

1222
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,140
and we

1223
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,860
four children

1224
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,520
could say

1225
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,000
we to the

1226
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,720
best of our

1227
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,600
ability we

1228
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
let them know

1229
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,360
we love them

1230
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,880
and we took

1231
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,440
care of them

1232
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,180
because it was

1233
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,740
a joy

1234
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
and we

1235
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,680
had no

1236
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,120
regrets

1237
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,480
and we

1238
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,100
left her

1239
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,620
grave

1240
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:52,900
and the

1241
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,240
four of

1242
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,620
us went

1243
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,940
to our

1244
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,260
different

1245
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,880
ways

1246
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,280
we kissed

1247
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,780
one another

1248
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,300
goodbye

1249
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,780
and my

1250
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,640
older sister

1251
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,140
left for

1252
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,580
East St.

1253
00:29:59,660 --> 00:29:59,860
Louis

1254
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,300
Illinois

1255
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,020
my younger

1256
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
sister for

1257
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,820

1258
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,140
Illinois

1259
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,980
my brother

1260
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,520
then to

1261
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,840
Richmond

1262
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,400
Indiana

1263
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,520
and I

1264
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,160
came back

1265
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,080
to Marion

1266
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,780
Ohio

1267
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,920
having stood

1268
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,840
at the grave

1269
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,520
of a Christian

1270
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,080
mother

1271
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,680
yes

1272
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,080
but one

1273
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,700
who again

1274
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,320
taught us

1275
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,780
something

1276
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,300
one who

1277
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,020
wanted to

1278
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,620
be loved

1279
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,140
my heart

1280
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,780
aches for

1281
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,500
many of you

1282
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,320
Christian mothers

1283
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,780
today

1284
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,560
who aren't

1285
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,020
loved

1286
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,820
whose children

1287
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,440
do not

1288
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,260
rise up

1289
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,980
and call you

1290
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,420
blessed

1291
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,080
who don't

1292
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,780
seem to

1293
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,180
care

1294
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,540
but I

1295
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
challenge you

1296
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,220
Christian mothers

1297
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,520
who are still

1298
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,320
training your

1299
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,820
children

1300
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,300
will you

1301
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,200
look at them

1302
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,060
every day

1303
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,680
as being

1304
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,160
a sword

1305
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,640
of first

1306
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,000
fruits

1307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,560
as something

1308
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,100
special

1309
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,620
in the sight

1310
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,100
of God

1311
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,860
something

1312
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,080
just so

1313
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,560
precious

1314
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,160
and so

1315
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,720
wonderful

1316
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,540
that again

1317
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:53,860
as you

1318
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,480
train them

1319
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,240
for life

1320
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,600
that you

1321
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,240
might have

1322
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,740
the joy

1323
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,220
someday

1324
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,640
that they

1325
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,180
will rise

1326
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,500
up and

1327
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,880
call you

1328
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,240
blessed

1329
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,460
I'd like

1330
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:00,960
to ask

1331
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,360
you as

1332
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,800
your children

1333
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,280
walk the

1334
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,020
glory road

1335
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,040
can they

1336
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,540
sing in

1337
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,260
the cross

1338
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,000
of Christ

1339
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,980
thy glory

1340
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,560
towering

1341
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:07,940
o'er the

1342
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,380
wrecks of

1343
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,860
time

1344
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,900
all the

1345
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,520
light of

1346
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,380
sacred story

1347
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,260
gathers round

1348
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,680
its head

1349
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,200
sublime

1350
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,900
because

1351
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,940
you told

1352
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,620
them about

1353
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,300
the cross

1354
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,040
of Christ

1355
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,660
oh if

1356
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,140
they have

1357
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,440
known

1358
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Christ

1359
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,760
from you

1360
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,860
and if

1361
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,300
you can

1362
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,280
see them

1363
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,620
tussled

1364
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,100
heads

1365
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,620
to be

1366
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,080
sure

1367
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
as a

1368
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,660
sword

1369
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,160
of first

1370
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,580
fruits

1371
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,280
as something

1372
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,960
special

1373
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,400
as the

1374
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,720
apple

1375
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,320
of God's

1376
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,640
eye

1377
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,200
I wish

1378
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,860
for you

1379
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,460
today

1380
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,840
that your

1381
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,240
children

1382
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,000
rise up

1383
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,360
and they

1384
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,940
call you

1385
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,340
blessed

1386
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,680
I wish

1387
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,160
you a

1388
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,580

1389
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,820
Mother's
