1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,620
Let us hear the word of God for this Sunday as we find it in our epistolary lesson.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,460
Read there in Paul's letter to the Romans, the 11th chapter, especially the 33rd verse.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,260
Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,640
How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,880
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,760
Oh, Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,300
In Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,760
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:06,020
Today, as I have mentioned, the Christian Church is celebrating Trinity Sunday.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,360
This is the Sunday set aside so that Christians may take a look at their God and ask themselves,

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,880
who is God?

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,920
Is God a God worthy of praise and adoration and thanksgiving?

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,140
Trinity Sunday brings to an end the festival half of the church year.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,600
We divide the regular church year into the festival half and also the non-festival half.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,080
You remember this church year began in the Advent season,

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:49,180
and in the Advent season we prepared ourselves for the great festival of the blessing of Jesus coming into the world, his birthday.

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,360
Then, you know, came the Epiphany season, when we celebrated the festival of Epiphany,

19
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,960
when the Gentiles came and they found that Christ was also their Lord and their Savior.

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,740
Then we went into the Lenten season and there came Palm Sunday, when our Christ rode into Jerusalem.

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,440
Then came Good Friday, the very anniversary when he suffered and died for the sins of the world,

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,920
followed by Easter, the festival of the resurrection.

23
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,080
Forty days later, then came the Ascension, which we celebrated.

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,180
Ten days after the Ascension came Pentecost, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
the festival that we celebrated last Sunday.

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,540
Today now comes the festival of the Trinity.

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:37,000
This is a bit different from the other festivals, in that it does not commemorate any one great fact in history.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,080
But this is a festival of the Christian church when we pause and we take a look at our God,

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,660
and we look at him and we ask ourselves, what is God like?

30
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,820
Is God worthy of our praise?

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Is he worthy of our love?

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,540
Is God worthy of our obedience?

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,400
And this morning we are going to have a little Jew from Tarsus up in Cilicia answer the question for us.

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,620
When we look at Paul, who was also the great war horse of the Christian church,

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,880
and we ask him, Paul, is God worthwhile?

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,600
Is God a God who is worthy of our love and of our honor and of our praise?

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,560
The little Jew from up in Cilicia way would answer you and me,

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
God is a great God, and God is worthy of our love,

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,500
and he is worthy of our praise and worthy of our thanksgiving.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,440
And all because this is what Paul found in him.

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,820
And he goes into this doxality, he says,

42
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,780
Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,180
how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
In simple English, Paul of Tarsus says,

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,460
God is a great God.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,720
God is worthy of your love and of your admiration,

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,900
because look at the riches of his wisdom and of his knowledge.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,020
Oh, it is so deep, says Paul, the depth of it.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,740
It is so immense.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,320
It is so limitless.

51
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,420
It is absolutely so unlimited.

52
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,920
It is deeper than the ocean itself.

53
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,980
It is so vast.

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,280
It is absolutely so immense

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,080
that the best that we can do is only to scratch the surface of his intellect.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,980
We can only grope.

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,240
We can never fully understand it.

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
We can never fully grasp it.

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,260
We can never fully digest it.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,560
And so on Trinity Sunday,

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,620
Paul would say to you and me,

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,380
God is a God worth knowing.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,920
Consider the riches of the depth of his wisdom and of his knowledge.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,900
It is deeper than the ocean.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
It is vast.

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
It is limitless.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,440
It is immense.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,740
And yet you and I on Trinity Sunday,

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,420
in looking at those words of Paul,

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,560
we may say to ourselves,

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,680
well, we'd like to believe that God is a God worth knowing

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
because of the depth of his wisdom and of his knowledge.

73
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,640
But we say, look at the world.

74
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,500
Look what the world says about the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Isn't it so that the world looks at you and me as Christians and says,

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,480
you Christians are always talking about the depth of the knowledge and the wisdom of God.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
You're talking about its immensity.

78
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,200
You're talking about its vastness.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,500
You're trying to say that you cannot ever fully comprehend it.

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,560
And yet the world says the wisdom of God is nothing but nonsense.

81
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,780
The world says it's only foolishness.

82
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,520
It is ridiculous what you Christians call the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,960
Well, if God's wisdom and knowledge are ridiculous,

84
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,240
if, again, these things are foolishness,

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,580
if these things are nonsense,

86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,500
then you and I would have to say that God is not a God worth knowing.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,220
And yet Saul of Tarsus says, oh, the depth of the riches of his wisdom and of his knowledge.

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,340
Could it be possible that when the world hears of the riches of God's wisdom and understanding,

89
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:06,160
that the world, in calling it nonsense, does not realize that the wisdom and the knowledge of God are a higher wisdom,

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,220
a wisdom that the world has never dreamed of?

91
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Perhaps as we look at the wisdom and the knowledge of God,

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,160
that you and I will see that here is wisdom and here is knowledge

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,060
that is so far above the wisdom of the world,

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,580
that no man of the world, regardless of his intellectual acumen,

95
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,980
regardless of his attainments,

96
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,500
has ever even dreamed of this kind of wisdom and this kind of knowledge.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,640
This morning on Trinity Sunday, let's look at the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Let's see whether it isn't a higher wisdom,

99
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,840
whether it isn't something that the world of intellect has never even dreamed of or thought of.

100
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,920
Would you like to see some of the wisdom of God and have it mentioned

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,100
that the world calls nonsense, but only because it has never even thought of such wisdom?

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,620
Here's the first thing.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,640
The wisdom and the knowledge of God has revealed unto us that God is one God,

104
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,780
and yet at the same time he is three persons.

105
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,480
Today is Trinity Sunday.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,460
Today is the Sunday when we stop and we look at our God and we say,

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,980
We have one God.

108
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,920
Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,560
And yet at the same time, this one God reveals himself as having three persons,

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
as being three persons.

111
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,460
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit,

112
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,600
and that these three are one, and yet they are distinct.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,200
There is not three gods, there is one God.

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,120
And yet three persons in the world stand and say,

115
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,660
See, that is nonsensical.

116
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,620
That doesn't make sense.

117
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,260
That is foolishness.

118
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
That is ridiculous.

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,980
And yet you and I stand and we say to the world,

120
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,320
Look, is there any religion that is man-made that has a three-in-one God?

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,900
Is there any human mind that has ever conceived that God could be one God,

122
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,120
and yet at the same time three persons at the same time?

123
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,520
The world, if it's going to label the Trinity as being something nonsensical,

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,220
would have to prove that the world thought of it first,

125
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,200
and that the world discarded it as being absolutely unfit for human intellect.

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,660
And yet there is no Trinity in any other religion.

127
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,660
There are a multiplicity of gods, but not one God in three persons,

128
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,320
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,700
And so to the world, God says,

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,060
Here is knowledge, here is wisdom that is above the knowledge and wisdom of the world.

131
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,140
Here is wisdom that no human being has ever thought of.

132
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,260
And think of the wisdom of God in revealing himself as one God in three persons

133
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,660
that you and I cannot accurately understand,

134
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,980
that you and I cannot fully comprehend to be sure,

135
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,100
because who knows the mind of God?

136
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,300
Who has ever given advice to God?

137
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,580
And then, who has ever given something to God

138
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,760
that God in turn must give us something back?

139
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,580
And our God reveals himself in this wisdom and knowledge that is above human wisdom,

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,640
that again the world has never dreamed of that he is an eternal God.

141
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,460
That God is without beginning and without ending.

142
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,340
No human being has ever dreamed that God could be like that.

143
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
That there was never a time when God didn't exist.

144
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,380
There never will be a time when God will not exist.

145
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,960
That God is all-powerful.

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,060
That God can do anything.

147
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,980
God has revealed that he, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit,

148
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,380
that again God knows everything.

149
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,520
There is in God all knowledge.

150
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,040
Nothing is hidden from his eyes.

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,160
That God is a God of perfect wisdom.

152
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,520
That God uses his knowledge in the very best possible way

153
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,220
that God never makes any mistakes.

154
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, what a God he is.

155
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,420
That God is everywhere present.

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,880
All of God all over at the same time.

157
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
The world stands and says,

158
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,720
that's nonsense because we cannot comprehend such a God.

159
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,160
And yet the world must look up at a wisdom that is a higher wisdom.

160
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,340
No man has ever dreamed that God could fill heaven and earth.

161
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,620
God a person.

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,960
God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

163
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,100
That everywhere at the same time it defies the imagination of man.

164
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,340
And yet here is wisdom.

165
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,340
When Paul of Tarsus saw it, he says,

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,560
Oh, the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.

167
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,100
God is a holy God.

168
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,260
No human being ever conceived of a holy God.

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,480
Look at the gods of all man-made religions,

170
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,100
and they are gods like unto men.

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
They are gods that are sinful.

172
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,560
They are gods, again, guilty of the same things,

173
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,840
the same transgressions as are human beings.

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,960
But here is a God who is holy without sin.

175
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,160
Here is a God who reveals himself as a righteous God.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,480
A God that is always fair.

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,500
He never plays favorites.

178
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,280
And then our God has revealed something about himself

179
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,040
that no human brain has ever conceived,

180
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,020
and that he is a God of love.

181
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,580
Again, I challenge you,

182
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,000
go into any religion on the face of this earth.

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,340
Go into any religion.

184
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,820
You can spot it as a man-made religion,

185
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,380
apart from Christianity,

186
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,160
because no religion has the word love in it.

187
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,200
There isn't a human being on the face of the earth right now.

188
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,160
I care not his intellectual attainments,

189
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,500
who has ever dreamed that God could love him.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,540
God has revealed himself as a God of love.

191
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
This is the God who, again,

192
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,760
has a depth of wisdom deeper than the ocean itself,

193
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
so immense, so inexhaustible, so limitless,

194
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,960
that you and I stand and say,

195
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
he's a God worth knowing,

196
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,080
because he's also a God who is trustworthy,

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,100
a God who keeps his promises.

198
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,820
And the word of God reveals

199
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,260
that in this wisdom and in this knowledge of God,

200
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,420
God tells us that God the Father created the universe,

201
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,840
that he created it for himself,

202
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,720
and it exists by his guidance and strength,

203
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,700
and that it shall accomplish the goal for which God did create it.

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,140
Paul could only say in his doxology,

205
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,860
for of him and through him and to him are all things.

206
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,180
God created the universe out of nothing.

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,960
He spoke by the power of his word.

208
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,980
And the world says that's foolishness.

209
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,680
And yet our God, here is a wisdom that is above human wisdom,

210
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,240
that God brought something out of nothing,

211
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,300
that God sustains this universe,

212
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,540
that he, by his laws,

213
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,960
which are nothing but the expressions of his will,

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
that God keeps this universe intact,

215
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,260
and that it shall be for him,

216
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,420
for the honor and glory and praise of his name.

217
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,720
That's the God that the little Jew up in Tarsus and Cilicia saw.

218
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,260
And that's why when he looked at the immensity of God,

219
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,820
he says, oh, the depth of the riches.

220
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,080
How deep the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!

221
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,160
How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!

222
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,540
This wisdom of God, is it nonsense?

223
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,800
Is it foolishness?

224
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
Is it something ridiculous?

225
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,360
Or again, is it heavenly wisdom that is above the wisdom of mankind?

226
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,560
And because on Trinity Sunday,

227
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,780
you and I see the depth of God's riches

228
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,840
in his wisdom and in his knowledge,

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,160
and we say to ourselves, it is immense,

230
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,360
and we can never completely grasp it.

231
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,920
We can only skype the surface.

232
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,300
Therefore, when Trinity Sunday comes,

233
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,040
and this is the Sunday when we honor God,

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,560
we ought to say, God is a God worth knowing.

235
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,640
And when we honor him as our God,

236
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,740
then we begin to realize that he is the only true God.

237
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,280
You and I have never seen God, have we?

238
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,540
And yet, how can we know that he is the only true God?

239
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,140
For the very obvious reason,

240
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,740
that in this wisdom and in this knowledge

241
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,480
which God has revealed about himself,

242
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,880
you and I find a God that we have never dreamed of,

243
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,680
a God that you and I can never even hope exists,

244
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,720
and yet a God that is perfect in all things

245
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,840
that you and I would never add one thing to him.

246
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,560
And when we realize that he is the only true God,

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,820
what does it mean for us today?

248
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,680
Doesn't it mean this,

249
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,840
that we can face the future without worry and without fear

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,820
and without questioning God's guidance into our life?

251
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,840
Oh, sometimes when sickness and adversity come to us,

252
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,620
we say, why did God send it to me?

253
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,260
And we look at our lives and we say,

254
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,540
yes, I know that I'm a sinner,

255
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,760
but I have never deliberately offended God.

256
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,000
I have worked in his kingdom.

257
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,160
I have tried to be a child of God to the best of my ability.

258
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,900
And why has God allowed these things to come?

259
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,300
But when you and I see the immensity of God's wisdom and power,

260
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,920
and we know that nothing happens in our life

261
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,140
except by his permission,

262
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
and we look at little Saul from Tarsus,

263
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,520
and we realize that there was the man,

264
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,260
the great war horse of the Christian church,

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,500
who knew what it was to have a thorn in the flesh,

266
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,020
and who knew again that God's grace was able to sustain him,

267
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,400
he realized that he couldn't understand the wisdom of God in his life,

268
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,300
but he knew this, that God was not punishing him,

269
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,240
and he knew that God was correcting him,

270
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,440
making of him what God wanted.

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,440
He realized that God was refining his life

272
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,140
as God refines your life and as he refines mine,

273
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,040
that in the refinements that come,

274
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,360
God can see his image in your life and mine.

275
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,460
We can face the future unafraid without worry,

276
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,720
without questioning and asking

277
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,640
why God allows things to come into your life and mine,

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,420
because we can stand on Trinity's Son and say,

279
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,860
he's a God worth knowing.

280
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,860
Look at the depth of his wisdom and knowledge.

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,360
It's deeper than the ocean,

282
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
it's immense, it's vast,

283
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,960
and a God who is that big,

284
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,180
in the great revelation of his knowledge and of his will,

285
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,340
is a God that is bigger than any need that arises in my life,

286
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,680
and you and I can have that joy and that peace

287
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
which the world cannot give

288
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,900
and which the world doesn't understand.

289
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,280
Today, it's an unusual festival.

290
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,100
It doesn't commemorate any event,

291
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,940
but this is the festival of the Trinity

292
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,420
when we take a look at our God

293
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,360
and we look at him and we say,

294
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
is he a God worth knowing?

295
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,720
Is he a God that I need in my life

296
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,080
or can I live without him?

297
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,800
And when Saul of Tarsus,

298
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
the little Jew from up Cilicia way,

299
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,100
looked at him,

300
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,660
he could only burst out and say,

301
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,960
oh, the depth of the riches,

302
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,840
both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

303
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,740
How unsearchable are his judgments

304
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
in these ways past finding out?

305
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,980
Paul said, let me tell you,

306
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,440
God is a God worth knowing.

307
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,980
He's worthy of honor and praise.

308
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,340
Look at him because his wisdom and his knowledge,

309
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,580
they're vast, they're deeper than the ocean.

310
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,680
Again, they are immense,

311
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
and you and I cannot ever completely understand

312
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,860
or grasp.

313
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,460
We can only look and see.

314
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,900
Why?

315
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,200
Because have you ever seen the wisdom of God?

316
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,160
What God has revealed,

317
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,260
the things that we know

318
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,220
that the world calls nonsense,

319
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,380
but only because the world doesn't realize

320
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,200
that it never dreamed of.

321
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,300
Here's the second thing.

322
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,340
The wisdom and the knowledge of God

323
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,940
have revealed that God's Son,

324
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,860
Jesus Christ,

325
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,940
atoned for the sins of the world.

326
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
The world looks and says,

327
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,900
you Christians,

328
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,140
when you talk about Christ and Calvary,

329
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,840
you're talking nonsense.

330
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,620
You're talking something that is foolishness.

331
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,140
You're talking something that is so ridiculous

332
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,660
that it is not worthy for the intellect of man.

333
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,300
And yet you and I look at them and we say,

334
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,140
when a man looks at Calvary

335
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,720
and a man rejects Calvary,

336
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,880
and when a man looks at the cross of Jesus Christ

337
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
and rejects him because it's foolishness,

338
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,460
that man must be able to say that he thought of that,

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,460
that he thought of a Christ and of a Calvary,

340
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,720
that he rejected it

341
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,460
because it was not even something

342
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,040
that was in keeping with the human intellect.

343
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,560
But I ask you,

344
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
go into any religion on the face of the earth

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,580
and you'll find two things absent.

346
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,300
There will be no Christ

347
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,520
and there will be no cross.

348
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,280
There will be no Savior.

349
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
And yet you and I stand

350
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,680
and we look at this wisdom of God

351
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,220
and we say,

352
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,480
who was this Jesus on the cross?

353
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,860
And the Word of God says,

354
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,900
he was very God,

355
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,540
a very God,

356
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,120
King of kings and Lord of lords.

357
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,880
In your intellect and mind we say,

358
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,440
but how could one man

359
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,020
atone for the sins of the world?

360
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,540
And again we look at him

361
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,320
and God answers,

362
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,700
because he was God,

363
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,240
because he was no less than uncreated God,

364
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,840
the Son of our great Trinity,

365
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,340
he was of more value than the human race.

366
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,660
And then our minds say,

367
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,380
but how could he,

368
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,620
when he died on the cross,

369
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,000
bear the equal of an eternity

370
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
in hell for the human race?

371
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,960
And as we stand at Calvary again,

372
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,420
just to scratch the surface

373
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
and we hear him cry out,

374
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,720
my God, my God,

375
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,140
why hast thou forsaken me?

376
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,940
We realize that he was forsaken of God,

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,440
but between God the Father

378
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,520
and God the Son,

379
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,580
there was laid on him to,

380
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,340
again,

381
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,760
too high for your mind

382
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,860
and mine to understand,

383
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,580
there was laid on him

384
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,720
an eternity in hell

385
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,380
for all men

386
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,500
and on the cross

387
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,720
in that suffering and death.

388
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,500
Someway, somehow,

389
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,340
he bore its equal for you and me

390
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,100
because he was God.

391
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,240
And we stand and the world says,

392
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,940
it's nonsense,

393
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,160
it's foolishness,

394
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,180
but there is no Christ,

395
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,040
there is no cross

396
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,740
in the human wisdom

397
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,560
of mankind.

398
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,720
And therefore,

399
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,400
there is this glorious assurance

400
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,880
that in the wisdom of God,

401
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,400
not only did the Son,

402
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
Jesus Christ,

403
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,920
bear the guilt

404
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,460
and the punishment

405
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,000
of the world,

406
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
but in his righteousness,

407
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,400
there is life

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,060
and salvation

409
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,320
for all men.

410
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
The world says,

411
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,340
how foolish

412
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,440
to have a substitute,

413
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,620
how foolish

414
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,960
that in the blood,

415
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,600
in the merit

416
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,320
of one person,

417
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,060
there could be life

418
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,620
and salvation

419
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,300
for the world.

420
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,100
Listen,

421
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,360
if that is foolishness,

422
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,340
then man must have

423
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,120
thought of it first

424
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
and man must have

425
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,900
rejected it.

426
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,100
But man has never dreamed

427
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
of a Christ,

428
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,860
of a Savior,

429
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,820
who could be so big

430
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,280
and yet a human being,

431
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,800
born flesh of our flesh

432
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,820
and bone of our bone

433
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,800
only without sin,

434
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,140
who could bring life

435
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,820
and salvation

436
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,460
for the world.

437
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,600
That's the kind of a God.

438
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,920
And is it any wonder

439
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,060
that Saul of Tarsus,

440
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,320
who realized his sin

441
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,280
and the enormity of it,

442
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,560
he looked at God

443
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,040
and he says,

444
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,940
God is a God

445
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,540
worth knowing.

446
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,860
And when he met God

447
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,040
on the Damascus way,

448
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,880
he realized

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,760
that God is someone

450
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,920
that is worthy

451
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,160
of praise and thanksgiving.

452
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,120
Look at his wisdom.

453
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,560
Oh, it's deeper

454
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,380
than the ocean.

455
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,380
It's immense.

456
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,320
It is inexhaustible.

457
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,060
It is limitless.

458
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,200
And that's why

459
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,900
on Trinity

460
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,880
we ought to say,

461
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,840
God is a God

462
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,360
worth knowing.

463
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,540
I need him in my life.

464
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,400
And therefore,

465
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,600
I shall repent

466
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,860
and put my trust

467
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,540
in Christ

468
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,900
as my Lord

469
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,360
and as my Savior.

470
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,320
We've all been reading

471
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,440
and again been aware

472
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,900
of the fact

473
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,460
that the Pope,

474
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,920
the head of the Roman Catholic Church

475
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,140
has recently died.

476
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,360
In the providence of God,

477
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,080
I had wished

478
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,580
that he might have lived

479
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,540
so that the ecumenical conference

480
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,140
might be reconvened

481
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,800
this fall,

482
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,940
which he was intending to do.

483
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,660
A man of peace

484
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,560
has died to be sure.

485
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,860
I had wished

486
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,420
for an ecumenical conference

487
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,820
because,

488
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,580
say what you will,

489
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,440
Christendom

490
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,520
is still divided.

491
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,320
And it is divided

492
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,980
on a very basic

493
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,920
and fundamental

494
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,220
and important issue.

495
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,320
And that is

496
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
the way to heaven.

497
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,580
Let's not forget it

498
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,200
and all of the movements

499
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,120
and the unions

500
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,020
of Christians

501
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,200
that the fundamental basis,

502
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,540
how do you go to heaven?

503
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,080
I had wished

504
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,660
and I still hope

505
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,260
that there will be

506
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,300
an ecumenical meeting

507
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,340
because in the Roman Catholic Church

508
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,640
today,

509
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,760
there are two commissions

510
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,560
that are studying

511
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,460
in that very problem.

512
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,880
One studying

513
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,100
the answer of the church

514
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,280
and the other group

515
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,220
studying the answer

516
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,160
of the word of God.

517
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,780
What does

518
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,820
the word of God say?

519
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,800
The word of God

520
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,420
says that the way to heaven

521
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,800
is Christ

522
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
and Christ alone,

523
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,360
Christ and his merits

524
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,260
without any merit

525
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,440
or worthiness

526
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,100
in your life

527
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,920
and mine.

528
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,140
Therefore,

529
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,360
if the way to heaven

530
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,860
is Jesus Christ,

531
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,740
then if you and I

532
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,380
repent and put our trust

533
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,900
in him,

534
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
then there comes to us

535
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,840
that peace

536
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,080
which the world

537
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,480
cannot give,

538
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,120
a peace that will never

539
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,020
question our eternal salvation.

540
00:20:59,680 --> 00:20:59,960
And yet,

541
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,160
isn't it strange

542
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,480
on that basis

543
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,740
how many of us

544
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,040
even as Protestants

545
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,140
do not understand

546
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,480
what it means

547
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,600
to be saved

548
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,980
by Christ alone

549
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,800
or by grace alone.

550
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,240
Just a moment,

551
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,220
if you know

552
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,820
what it means

553
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,620
to be saved

554
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,520
by grace

555
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,420
or if I do,

556
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,560
it ought to mean

557
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,480
this to us,

558
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
that on the day

559
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,640
of our death,

560
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,080
and you see,

561
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,420
you've got to die alone

562
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,260
and so do I.

563
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,640
This thing isn't

564
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,680
a matter of

565
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,400
determining

566
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
who's going to have

567
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,560
the greatest following.

568
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360
It is a matter

569
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,140
so important

570
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,980
that when the day

571
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,180
comes that you die

572
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
and you die alone,

573
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,900
that I die

574
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,940
and that I die alone,

575
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,460
that you and I

576
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,420
know the way to heaven.

577
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,820
That will be

578
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,980
the only thing

579
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,840
that matters.

580
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,220
If you and I

581
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,860
understand

582
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,920
what it means

583
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,660
to be saved

584
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,440
by grace

585
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,920
or by Christ alone,

586
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,320
it should mean

587
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,380
this on the day

588
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,980
of your death

589
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,500
and mine

590
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,300
when we're ready

591
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
to go into death alone

592
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,240
without human help.

593
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,240
It ought to mean

594
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,020
this that we say

595
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,820
something like this,

596
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,360
Lord, I've done

597
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,760
a lot of fine things

598
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,280
in life

599
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,940
in your kingdom.

600
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,160
I have done

601
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,940
a lot of good things.

602
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,760
I have done them

603
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,920
out of love

604
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,900
and out of appreciation

605
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,140
for my salvation

606
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,820
in Christ.

607
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,380
We ought to be able

608
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,740
to say,

609
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,560
Lord, I've given

610
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,780
my life for you.

611
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,940
I have been

612
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,020
the kind of a steward

613
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,920
that you would want

614
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,460
me to be

615
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,660
to a certain extent.

616
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,820
But if you know

617
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,440
what it means

618
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,580
to be saved by grace,

619
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,320
we ought to say,

620
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,840
but Lord,

621
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,900
these things end

622
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,860
right here.

623
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,200
Now, Lord,

624
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,240
since I am ready

625
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,060
to face death,

626
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,980
I leave all

627
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,280
of the fine things

628
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,980
that I have done

629
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,860
in life right here.

630
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,160
They shall stay

631
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,660
right here

632
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,440
because they will

633
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,240
do me no good

634
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,360
when I take

635
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,160
the next step

636
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,960
into eternity.

637
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,300
To be saved

638
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,940
by grace

639
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,820
means that then

640
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,000
we turn in the spirit

641
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,980
of this little Jew

642
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,680
from Tarsus

643
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,620
and that we say,

644
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:46,960
but Lord,

645
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,920
I know that I am

646
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,740
the chief of sinners,

647
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,540
even as Paul

648
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,160
admitted it,

649
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,280
and I know that

650
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,100
all of these things

651
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,640
that I have done,

652
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,860
they don't save me.

653
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,280
They are an expression

654
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,880
of my love.

655
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,100
I know that as regards

656
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,940
my salvation,

657
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,020
these things

658
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,060
are filthy rags

659
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,340
because they are

660
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,640
selfish at best.

661
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,640
They are not perfect,

662
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,980
but I know

663
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,840
a righteousness

664
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,040
that is perfect

665
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,800
and that's the

666
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,260
righteousness

667
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,380
of my Christ

668
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,180
and my Lord.

669
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,920
Then if you and I

670
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,480
really know

671
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,000
what it means

672
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,600
to be saved

673
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,320
by grace,

674
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,400
then we will stand

675
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,240
and face death

676
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,820
and we will say,

677
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,380
Lord Jesus,

678
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,660
I leave here

679
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,520
every decent thing

680
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,280
that I have ever done

681
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,940
for you because

682
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,480
from here on

683
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,860
it won't do me

684
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,300
a bit of good.

685
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,040
I rest my hope

686
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,860
and faith simply

687
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,100
means a simple trust.

688
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,660
If you don't know

689
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,480
what I am talking about,

690
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,000
I put my trust

691
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,900
and my confidence

692
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,620
in heaven,

693
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,520
in you,

694
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
Lord Jesus Christ,

695
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,660
in your goodness,

696
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,700
in your merit,

697
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,740
in your righteousness,

698
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,880
what you earn

699
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000
for me on Calvary

700
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
and I die

701
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,560
in that trust

702
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
and in that faith

703
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,220
and in that confidence.

704
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,440
That's what it means

705
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,180
to be saved

706
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,580
by grace.

707
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,200
Do you know that?

708
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,720
How many of us

709
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,840
belong to organizations

710
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
that talk about Christianity

711
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,540
where again,

712
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,160
Christianity

713
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,080
and salvation

714
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,700
seems to be

715
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,580
a human achievement?

716
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,080
May I just say

717
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,700
to you today,

718
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
watch your soul.

719
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,660
When death comes

720
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,500
to you and me,

721
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,080
we're going

722
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,660
in it alone.

723
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,140
And if you don't

724
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,960
know the Christ

725
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,500
who says,

726
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,560
I am the way,

727
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,600
if you don't understand

728
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,240
what it means

729
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,920
to be saved

730
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,160
by grace alone

731
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,140
without human achievement,

732
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
my heartfelt prayer

733
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,980
is you don't get out

734
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,580
of this church

735
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,240
this morning.

736
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,000
You aren't ready

737
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,640
to die

738
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,380
until you know

739
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,720
the story of grace.

740
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,140
This is Trinity Sunday

741
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,980
and thank God

742
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,580
the wisdom

743
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,260
that the world

744
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,640
calls foolishness,

745
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,880
the wisdom

746
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,560
that the world

747
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,880
says is ridiculous

748
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,080
because the world

749
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,160
wants human achievement.

750
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,920
Thank God

751
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,820
that our God

752
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,420
is a God

753
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,040
worth knowing

754
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,960
because he has

755
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,600
made known

756
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,680
wisdom and knowledge

757
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,460
that no human being

758
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,680
has ever dreamed of.

759
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,480
That like the malefactor

760
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,280
on the cross

761
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,100
who didn't have

762
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,340
one decent thing

763
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,040
in his favor

764
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,820
but who could turn

765
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,580
in a real

766
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,640
childlike trust

767
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:52,980
and say,

768
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,680
Lord Jesus,

769
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
remember me

770
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,660
when you come

771
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,440
into your kingdom

772
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,880
you and I

773
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,620
aren't ready

774
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,920
to make that

775
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,720
journey alone

776
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
because we are

777
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,040
on the wrong way.

778
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,900
That's Trinity Sunday.

779
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,300
When again

780
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,920
the little Jew

781
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,580
from Tarsus

782
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,100
who had met

783
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,640
that Lord

784
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,080
and who knew

785
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,460
that he was

786
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,080
chief of sinners

787
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,580
looked at God

788
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,060
and said,

789
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,460
oh,

790
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,200
what a God

791
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,840
we've got

792
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,820
worthy of again

793
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,480
of our love

794
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,200
and of our honor.

795
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,320
What did he say?

796
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,540
Oh,

797
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,460
the depth of the riches

798
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,180
of his wisdom

799
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,800
and knowledge.

800
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,840
Do you want to know

801
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,380
some wisdom

802
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,960
and knowledge

803
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,040
that has been revealed

804
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,800
that is above

805
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,320
the wisdom

806
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,840
of the world

807
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,460
not only

808
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,120
that our God

809
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,880
is one God

810
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,740
and yet three persons

811
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,700
not only

812
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,760
that Jesus Christ

813
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,540
God's Son

814
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,680
atoned for the sins

815
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,180
of the world

816
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,000
but God

817
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,220
the Holy Spirit

818
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,460
makes dead men

819
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,700
alive again.

820
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,140
The world says,

821
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,800
you Christians

822
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,660
in talking about

823
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,460
the Holy Spirit

824
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,040
coming to a man

825
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,220
and making a man

826
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,000
that is dead

827
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,860
alive again

828
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,800
how ridiculous

829
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,740
and how foolish

830
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,920
can you get?

831
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,300
and you and I say

832
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,900
but isn't it

833
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,680
a strange thing

834
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,440
when the Holy Spirit

835
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,640
came on Pentecost

836
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,840
that by means

837
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
of his word

838
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,580
that he can penetrate

839
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,600
into a human heart

840
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
that we are all

841
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
born dead

842
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,480
we are born

843
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,300
without the knowledge

844
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,800
of God

845
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,260
you and I

846
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,660
by nature

847
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,240
don't even know

848
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,900
who God is

849
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,300
you and I

850
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,880
have no fear

851
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,620
in love of God

852
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,580
we don't even know

853
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,100
who he is

854
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,900
to fear in love

855
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,700
you and I

856
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,220
are born

857
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,300
with concupiscence

858
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,040
we're born

859
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,240
with a downward

860
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
bent to hell

861
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,920
and you know

862
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,720
and so do I

863
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,460
we're all born

864
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,160
going down

865
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
to the barnyard

866
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,680
that's the way

867
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,260
we're born

868
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,960
because we're

869
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,060
spiritually dead

870
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,740
we love them

871
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,440
we don't love God

872
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
then isn't it strange

873
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,260
that this Holy Spirit

874
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,040
the third person

875
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,360
of the Trinity

876
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,120
through the word of God

877
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,360
comes and makes

878
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,460
dead men alive again

879
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,140
what's the world

880
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,600
going to do

881
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,180
it can yell

882
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,760
all at once

883
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,200
to and say

884
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,020
this is ridiculous

885
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,000
this is crazy

886
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,060
but look at the

887
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,880
kingdom of God

888
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,900
look at the hundreds

889
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,620
and millions

890
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,460
of who have stood up

891
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,760
and said

892
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,920
we've been born again

893
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,980
of water and the spirit

894
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,240
we have come into

895
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,120
a living relationship

896
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,840
with God

897
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,860
we have learned

898
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,420
what it means

899
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,020
to trust in Jesus Christ

900
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,160
and we have been

901
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,580
born again

902
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,660
we are twice born men

903
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,260
men that have gone out

904
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,380
and given their lives

905
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,440
for Jesus Christ

906
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,260
and the world says

907
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,880
you're crazy

908
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,840
and you're fools

909
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,420
and you and I say

910
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,240
oh the depth

911
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,760
of the rich

912
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,800
is both of the wisdom

913
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,860
and the knowledge of God

914
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,360
and oh it's such

915
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,240
a marvelous wisdom

916
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,340
because the Holy Spirit

917
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,120
assures you and me

918
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,620
that he works

919
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,380
with all the power

920
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,880
that is needed

921
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,600
on any man

922
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,180
to bring any man

923
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,820
to life

924
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,780
when a man

925
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,760
has come into this world

926
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,220
being born dead in sin

927
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,540
there isn't anybody

928
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,600
within the sound

929
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,360
of my voice

930
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,240
who if he allows

931
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,320
God the Holy Spirit

932
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,020
through the word

933
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,840
to come into his heart

934
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,940
but what that spirit

935
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
will make him alive

936
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,380
any man within

937
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,540
the sound of my voice

938
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,120
right now

939
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,260
who is going to be lost

940
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,120
on the last day

941
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,880
and repudiated

942
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
is going to be lost

943
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
because he said

944
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,080
no to the Holy Spirit

945
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,620
it is not because

946
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,340
the Holy Spirit

947
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,600
did not work effectively

948
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,400
in his heart

949
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,420
it is because

950
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,760
a man repudiated it

951
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,700
and said it's nonsense

952
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,640
it's ridiculous

953
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,100
it is only something

954
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,020
to laugh at

955
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,180
and that's why

956
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,360
on Trinity Sunday

957
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,320
oh it's a strange festival

958
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,080
it's the time

959
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,960
when we look at God

960
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,080
you and I

961
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,680
ought to give him

962
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,200
our thanks

963
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,080
and say I can't live

964
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,740
without him

965
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,320
he is worthy

966
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,040
of my trust

967
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,140
and then we ought

968
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,040
to thank him

969
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,580
that he has called us

970
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,380
why did God

971
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,540
ever call you

972
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,860
why did he ever

973
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,980
call me

974
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,600
if there was ever

975
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
a time when I felt

976
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
humble and wondered

977
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
that same question

978
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,940
it's when I was

979
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,800
down in Egypt

980
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,780
and I was down

981
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,480
in Luxor

982
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
450 miles

983
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,020
south of Cairo

984
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,200
I saw filth

985
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,060
and poverty

986
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,120
and ignorance

987
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,660
the likes of which

988
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,020
I never realized

989
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,460
existed in this world

990
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,900
people living

991
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,840
in the tombs

992
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,780
with the dead

993
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,980
groveling

994
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,760
in dirt

995
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
and in sand

996
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,740
blinded

997
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
nothing to eat

998
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,840
ignorant

999
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,060
dirty

1000
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,860
filthy

1001
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,940
when I stood

1002
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,080
in that squalor

1003
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
I said to myself

1004
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,940
I wonder why

1005
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
God ever

1006
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,420
called me

1007
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,840
in Jesus Christ

1008
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,260
I wonder why

1009
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,220
I was born

1010
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,560
in a Christian home

1011
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,160
in America

1012
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
I wonder why

1013
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,000
I was born

1014
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,040
where I was born

1015
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,360
and not over here

1016
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
and I had to say

1017
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,340
to myself

1018
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,700
I didn't deserve it

1019
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,680
and neither do you

1020
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
nor does any man

1021
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
why were you

1022
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,720
and I

1023
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,300
born

1024
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,320
where we're born

1025
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,480
and why

1026
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,160
the other man

1027
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,960
in the squalor

1028
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,180
where he finds himself

1029
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,660
when you and I

1030
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,700
look and we grasp

1031
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,740
at the very knowledge

1032
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,380
and the wisdom

1033
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,880
of God

1034
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,340
we say

1035
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,740
God must have

1036
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,560
called us

1037
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,400
for a purpose

1038
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,040
and when Paul

1039
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,820
realized

1040
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,180
and said

1041
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,880
why did God

1042
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,500
call me

1043
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,840
remember when Paul

1044
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,500
said he appeared

1045
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,240
to me as one

1046
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,280
born out of due time

1047
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,880
the Greek word

1048
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
is fetus

1049
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,980
the little Jew

1050
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,900
said God

1051
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,600
appeared to me

1052
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,520
as a fetus

1053
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
as an unborn

1054
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,940
premature child

1055
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,380
something that's

1056
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,460
horrible to look at

1057
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm a fetus

1058
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,100
why did God

1059
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,060
ever call me

1060
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,200
and then he said

1061
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
but he did call me

1062
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
and I owe a debt

1063
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,600
of gratitude

1064
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,320
to the world

1065
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm going to share

1066
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,860
this God

1067
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,200
I'm going to pay

1068
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,320
my debt of gratitude

1069
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,220
I'm going out

1070
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,320
and I'm going to

1071
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,840
tell men

1072
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
about Jesus Christ

1073
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,820
we're sitting here

1074
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,400
an American

1075
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,120
we've got some

1076
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,920
of the grandest

1077
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,640
blessings that

1078
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,300
God Almighty

1079
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,900
ever gave

1080
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,560
and some of us

1081
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,760
sit on our hands

1082
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,840
and we've never

1083
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,360
said to ourselves

1084
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,200
why did God

1085
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,100
ever choose me

1086
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,380
why am I saved

1087
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,500
and we don't

1088
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,400
turn our hand

1089
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,160
to sharing it

1090
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,120
with someone else

1091
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,620
when are we

1092
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,360
going to say

1093
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,860
here is a wisdom

1094
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,340
the world

1095
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,180
can laugh at it

1096
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,560
the world

1097
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,140
can call it

1098
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,540
nonsense

1099
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,040
the world

1100
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,920
can say it's crazy

1101
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,040
but oh

1102
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,360
Saul of Tarsus

1103
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,200
yes the great

1104
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,680
war horse

1105
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,000
he said

1106
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
I'm not ashamed

1107
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,460
of the gospel

1108
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,040
of Christ

1109
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,000
why it's the

1110
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,700
power of God

1111
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,320
to salvation

1112
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,000
to every man

1113
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,520
that believeth

1114
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,240
he says

1115
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,080
and to the Jews

1116
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,220
I know a stumbling

1117
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,740
block

1118
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,920
and to the Gentiles

1119
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
it's foolishness

1120
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
but to them

1121
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,640
that are called

1122
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,900
the power of God

1123
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,860
and the wisdom

1124
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,700
of God

1125
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,920
today

1126
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,000
have your eyes

1127
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,020
seen the glory

1128
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,440
can you say

1129
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
mine eyes

1130
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,420
have seen the glory

1131
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
of a great God

1132
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,220
and I can't live

1133
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,900
without him

1134
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,500
can you go out

1135
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,200
on the glory road

1136
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,220
and say I love

1137
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,520
to tell the story

1138
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,460
of unseen things

1139
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:56,900
above

1140
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,520
of Jesus

1141
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
and his glory

1142
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,140
of Jesus

1143
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,980
and his love

1144
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,300
I love to tell

1145
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,820
the story

1146
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,600
because a note

1147
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,220
is true

1148
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,400
it satisfies

1149
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,420
my longing

1150
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,280
as nothing else

1151
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,800
can do

1152
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,340
I love to tell

1153
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,140
the story

1154
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,300
it will be my

1155
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
theme and glory

1156
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,420
to tell the old

1157
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,220
old story

1158
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,400
of Jesus

1159
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
and his love

1160
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,040
Trinity Sunday

1161
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,480
is God

1162
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,620
a God worth having

1163
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,120
oh he is

1164
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,180
look at his

1165
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,220
wisdom and knowledge

1166
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,020
look at its depth

1167
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,800
deeper than the ocean

1168
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,180
limitless

1169
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,420
vast

1170
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,800
so much

1171
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,600
that you and I

1172
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,020
can never

1173
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,560
completely understand it

1174
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,540
but oh

1175
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,140
when we have

1176
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,080
experienced it

1177
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,980
in our lives

1178
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,020
the wisdom of God

1179
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,520
and the power

1180
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:40,540
and the power

1181
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,220
of God

1182
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,400
amen

1183
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,880
the peace of God

1184
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,960
which passeth all

1185
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,140
human understanding

1186
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,380
keep and unite

1187
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,460
your hearts and minds

1188
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,580
in Christ Jesus

1189
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,620
unto life

1190
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,360
everlasting

1191
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,600
everlasting
