1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,100
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,640
Let us hear the Word of God, the regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,080
as we find it in the first letter of John, the fourth chapter, part of the sixteenth verse.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
God is love.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,420
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,500
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,100
In Christ Jesus, the Christ of Christian fathers, dear friends,

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,360
you who are here in God's house this morning, and you also, Christian friends,

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,680
who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
Today, as you know, is the first Sunday after Trinity.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,240
It is the Sunday that begins the non-festival half of the church year.

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,000
You recall last Sunday we celebrated Trinity Sunday,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,060
and that Sunday marked the end of the festival half.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,920
That means from now on to the end of this church year,

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,220
we shall number the Sundays after Trinity,

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,560
today being the first, and we will find that there will be 24 Sundays after Trinity

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
in this non-festival half of the church year.

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,720
Today, however, is not only the first Sunday after Trinity,

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,040
it is also Father's Day, since it is the third Sunday in June.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,620
And our text for today is very appropriate for the occasion.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Speaking to us in the word of God is John,

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,020
the beloved disciple, the disciple whom Jesus loved.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,060
And John, in speaking to us in the word of God,

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,160
says this about our God,

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,560
God is love.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,820
We may say to ourselves here in church this morning,

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,120
what does that mean?

28
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,980
If we could just bring that down to where you and I live

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,240
and make it simple, it means this.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,380
The fact that God is love in your life and mine,

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,440
therefore that means that if the very heart of God is love,

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,180
if the very core of his essence is love,

33
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,520
then it simply means that in your life and mine,

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,760
God ever yearns and longs for our eternal salvation,

35
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,760
never for our eternal loss,

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,260
regardless of what our attitude may be towards him,

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,220
regardless of how we treat him.

38
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,980
That's what it means when the word of God says,

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
God is love.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,620
It means that you and I can snub our nose at God if we want to.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
It means that you and I can be very hostile.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,580
It means that you and I can treat him as the very dust under our feet.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,340
It means that you and I may turn in rebellion against God,

44
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,280
but God still yearns and longs for our eternal good,

45
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,880
never for our eternal loss.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,680
The one thing that God hopes will never happen to you or me

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,780
is that you and I would lose our soul.

48
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,900
That's what it means when the word of God says,

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,740
God is love.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
And somehow or other you and I this morning may say to ourselves,

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,880
that sounds just a little bit too good to be true.

52
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,700
Do you mean to say that we can trample God underfoot,

53
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,960
that you and I can thumb our noses at God,

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,380
that we can ridicule him,

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,000
that we can laugh at him,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,360
and that God still yearns,

57
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,200
that from the depths of his soul he desires our eternal good

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,620
and never our eternal harm,

59
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,520
that it makes no difference how we react to him,

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,240
it makes no difference how we treat him,

61
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,340
that he still longs and wants us saved.

62
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,500
We may say,

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,100
Oh, that can't be like God.

64
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,120
God can't be like that.

65
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,240
Because, you see,

66
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,420
you and I feel we can't be like that.

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,980
And how in the world could God be a God like that?

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,180
But on this Father's Day,

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,500
as we look at God,

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,940
and the word of God says that he is love,

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,680
his very heart,

72
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,960
the essence of his being is love,

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,500
not only is God that kind of a God,

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,140
whoever aims for our eternal welfare

75
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,680
and never for our loss,

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,840
regardless of how we treat him,

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,340
not only is God that kind of a God,

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,960
but he has demonstrated that kind of love to us,

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
and he's proved it.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,700
Look at this in the first place.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,000
God promised a Savior to us

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,700
when we were his enemies.

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Don't forget that.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,660
God, out of love

85
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,740
and out of the omnipotence that was his,

86
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,700
he brought this universe into being,

87
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,860
not only to show the glory of his very being,

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,920
but also that he might demonstrate his love,

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,100
and he created man in his own image,

90
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,080
and he put man, Adam and Eve,

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,740
our first parents on this earth,

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,660
that God might love them

93
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,600
and that they might in turn love him.

94
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,900
And what happened?

95
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,120
When God created our first parents

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,200
and created them in holiness and in righteousness

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,260
that they might serve him in love,

98
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,780
they chose not to love him,

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,480
and they disobeyed,

100
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,980
and they did that which they knew was wrong.

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
When they ate of the tree

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
that God told them not to eat of,

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,640
and they became God's enemies,

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,240
and then when you go to the Garden of Eden,

105
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,880
what happened?

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,340
When Adam and Eve realized that they were naked

107
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,840
and they ran and they hid themselves,

108
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,980
God called, did he not,

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,720
and said, Adam, where are you?

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,260
It was the first call of love to God's enemies.

111
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,180
And because our first parents were the world,

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
therefore they were you and they were me.

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,820
And because, again, God said, where are you?

114
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,860
There was the love of God,

115
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,720
and when God spoke to Satan

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
and to Adam and Eve that day,

117
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,220
he said, and I will put enmity

118
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,360
between thee and the woman,

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,120
between thy seed and her seed.

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,860
It shall bruise thy head,

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,220
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

122
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,060
God promised that from Eve

123
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,380
would come the seed of the woman,

124
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,880
a Savior,

125
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,300
who again would bring life and salvation

126
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,500
while we were his enemies.

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,440
God is a God of love,

128
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,060
and he demonstrated in the very Garden of Eden

129
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,980
when sin came into the world.

130
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,740
And not only did God demonstrate it in promise,

131
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,020
but God fulfilled that promise,

132
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,580
and he sent the Savior in spite of the way

133
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,720
his children treated him.

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Did you ever read the Old Testament

135
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,000
and see just what a response

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,440
God's children gave him in response to his love?

137
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,660
Did you ever say,

138
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,700
well, how could God be a God of love?

139
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,380
How could God love and desire our salvation

140
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,420
and never our loss?

141
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,620
How could God be a God who would say

142
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,880
that the one thing I never want to have happen

143
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,180
is that you'd be lost

144
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,640
in spite of the way you treat me?

145
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Now look in the Old Testament.

146
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,980
Here, Adam and Eve had sons, Cain and Abel,

147
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,940
and from Abel was to come the Christ,

148
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,960
and Cain killed Abel.

149
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,860
You'd have thought God would have said,

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,100
that's enough, I'm through.

151
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,020
And yet God raised up another son, Seth, didn't he?

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,500
And you come down to the time of Noah.

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,800
And in the time of Noah,

154
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,780
God gave the people,

155
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,840
because they were so wicked,

156
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,800
120 years to repent.

157
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,300
And God loved them.

158
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,160
And yet in spite of 120 years of entreaty,

159
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,260
the world turned against God,

160
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,460
and they forced God to bring destruction.

161
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,940
Even though God's love continued,

162
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
his love was not abated.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,140
God still loved them,

164
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,800
and a million times desired their salvation

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,100
rather than their loss.

166
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,740
But because it was unrequited love,

167
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,040
it was an unresponsive love to God,

168
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,800
there came punishment.

169
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
But the love of God saved Noah and his wife,

170
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,660
and the three sons and their three wives.

171
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,560
Then you go on down to Abraham,

172
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,180
who dwelt in the home of idols.

173
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,940
God's people were forgetting him.

174
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,340
And God chose Abraham,

175
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
and brought him from the land of Ur of the Chaldees

176
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,580
into the land of Palestine.

177
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,860
And God told him that he would have a son,

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,960
and from that son would come Jesus Christ,

179
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,460
the Savior.

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,120
And again, Abraham and Sarah couldn't wait,

181
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,920
and they didn't believe.

182
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,540
And so there was the incident with Hagar,

183
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,220
and with Ishmael being born.

184
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,420
But finally God gave them a son because God loved.

185
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,780
And then there came from Isaac and his wife,

186
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,580
Rebekah, there came Esau and Jacob.

187
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,980
And Jacob couldn't wait for the birthright.

188
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
He had to get it by intrigue.

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,540
And he had to flee for his life.

190
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,200
But the love of God was there.

191
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,180
And finally Jacob came back,

192
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,080
and then they sold Joseph into slavery.

193
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
And they came on down into Egypt,

194
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,480
and they were down in Egypt over 300 years.

195
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,000
And God raised up a Moses,

196
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,480
and he led them back into the land of Palestine,

197
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,980
and gave them the land that David came on the throne.

198
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,180
And finally because mankind turned against God,

199
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,040
there came Nebuchadnezzar in the year 586 before Christ

200
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,420
and destroyed the southern kingdom

201
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,380
and carried the Jews away into Babylonian captivity

202
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,540
for 70 years.

203
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,900
But there was the love of God

204
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,840
because a man by the name of Cyrus,

205
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,780
the Cyrus who was the Mede and the Persian,

206
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,020
arose, and by the providence of God

207
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,420
he enabled the Jews to go back to their own land.

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,880
And then there came 400 years of silence,

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,880
and then finally God broke the silence,

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,900
and God fulfilled his promise,

211
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,160
and the Savior that God promised in Eden

212
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,620
came into the world.

213
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,280
You talk about the love of God,

214
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,560
you and I can say,

215
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,120
you mean that God is love,

216
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,220
that his heart is love,

217
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
that God ever would plan and yearn

218
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,580
for our eternal welfare,

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,780
never our damnation,

220
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,320
in spite of the way we treat him.

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,060
Look in the history of the word of God,

222
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,760
and you find that love is there,

223
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,060
and it was demonstrated

224
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,000
beyond the shadow of a wish.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,540
And today is Father's Day.

226
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,080
And as one father to another father,

227
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,480
this ought to be the day when we look at God

228
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,140
and we say that God is love.

229
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,900
That means that in spite of the attitude of man,

230
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,160
in spite of the reaction of man to God,

231
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,920
in spite of whether man is friendly or hostile,

232
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,740
that God ever yearns and longs

233
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,280
for a man's eternal goodness and ever his evil,

234
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,320
then we ought to say to ourselves today,

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
God, I want to be loved even as you are loved.

236
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,220
We as Christian fathers ought to say to ourselves,

237
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,680
God, I want to be like you in this.

238
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,620
I want to love even as you love me.

239
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,760
And if you and I as fathers would love that way,

240
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,220
then and only then would we know

241
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,940
how to treat our wives

242
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,600
who are the mothers of our children.

243
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,140
How do you treat a wife?

244
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,080
How does a Christian husband and father

245
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
treat a wife?

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,460
What's the criterion?

247
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,580
What's the principle on which this thing is worth?

248
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,720
It's rather strange.

249
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,260
Some of you young girls contemplating marriage come.

250
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,920
Some of you who are already married

251
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,020
have come to me and have said,

252
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,100
How do you know that you really love somebody?

253
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
How can you be sure

254
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,380
that even though you have married somebody

255
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,200
that you love him?

256
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
Now there ought to be affection

257
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,700
in a home to be sure.

258
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,680
I gave you a test once

259
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,180
and I don't know of a better one

260
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,420
to know whether you really have affection

261
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,500
and real love

262
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,040
and if there's an appeal to your mate.

263
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,640
Can you use his toothbrush?

264
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,380
I don't know of anything any better.

265
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,520
If you can use his toothbrush

266
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,640
or he can use yours.

267
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,700
There's affection.

268
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,580
There's real love.

269
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,260
But there's got to be a higher love

270
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
than that of affection

271
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,680
because again,

272
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,880
there are stresses and strains in marriage

273
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,300
where there's got to be something even higher.

274
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,080
There's got to be this love

275
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,800
that God has for us.

276
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,320
There's got to be in the home

277
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,280
on the part of a Christian father

278
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,140
this kind of love

279
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,460
that his aim and his longing at all times

280
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,780
is for the eternal welfare of his wife

281
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,700
and the mother of his children

282
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,360
and never to treat her in any way

283
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,040
whereby he might jeopardize

284
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
and endanger her eternal welfare.

285
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,800
I ask you this morning,

286
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
can you imagine a home

287
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,680
where father and mother

288
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,840
are motivated with this love that God has

289
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,500
where both of them have this criterion

290
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,460
and this principle

291
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,360
in treating one another

292
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240
that this is the basis

293
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,280
that it's love

294
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,980
that there is every yearning

295
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,120
for the eternal salvation of the other one.

296
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,200
Never to say or do anything

297
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,460
that might endanger

298
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,240
or that might thwart

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,260
the eternal welfare of the other person.

300
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,460
Can you imagine how

301
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,700
under the most grave circumstances

302
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,640
any home could ever be broken in divorce?

303
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,280
I can't.

304
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,780
And yet what sometimes you wives come and you say

305
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,440
but there are problems in marriage.

306
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,220
You say we've been brought up

307
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,700
to know a certain thing is wrong.

308
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,980
We've been brought up to say again

309
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,380
this thing of sex is wrong

310
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,440
and suddenly you're married

311
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
and then suddenly everything becomes right

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,280
can you say we have a guilty feeling

313
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,960
in the marital act

314
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,100
which is ours again

315
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,260
as husband and wife.

316
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,040
What is the answer to that?

317
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,320
Again, bear this in mind.

318
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
When the commandment says

319
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,040
thou shalt not commit adultery,

320
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,620
the word adultery,

321
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,100
we get the word adulterate from that

322
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,600
and that word means

323
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
again to spoil something that is good.

324
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
God doesn't tell us

325
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,260
that there's anything wrong in sex.

326
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,820
There is nothing wrong

327
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,500
with marital cohabitation

328
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,360
but God has set that aside for marriage

329
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,940
and it was wrong

330
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,880
not that it is wrong in itself

331
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,460
but it was wrong before marriage

332
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,880
that in marriage it might be used

333
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,600
and it might be used

334
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,860
in the love that God has for us.

335
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,680
When husband and wife

336
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,900
can again,

337
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,660
can engage in the marital relationships,

338
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,060
the intimate relationship

339
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,540
with a love toward one another

340
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,200
that God has to them

341
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,620
with again this kind of love

342
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,820
that there is a yearning

343
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,980
for the eternal salvation of one another

344
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,520
and never for that person's loss

345
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,040
regardless of the relationship

346
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,700
then that feeling of guilt goes away.

347
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,760
Then there is a love of concern

348
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,240
for the eternal welfare

349
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,340
and then and only then

350
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,900
can you and I have the joy

351
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,800
that homes are not going to be broken up.

352
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,860
Oh, it does make a difference

353
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,520
when we marry him.

354
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,980
There was Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens,

355
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,820
you and I remember him as a humorist

356
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,540
and we think about his huckleberry fin

357
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,400
but after his death, you know,

358
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,380
there was probably some of his writings

359
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,200
which certainly do him no credit.

360
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
We know him as a humorist

361
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,600
but how many of us know Mark Twain

362
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
as a man that was an infidel,

363
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,800
a man that hated the very ground

364
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,140
God walked on,

365
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,240
a man that spewed at God,

366
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
a man that had no use for him,

367
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,600
that treated God as the scum under his feet.

368
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,660
You know, he married a Christian girl

369
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,700
and when he proposed to her,

370
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
she said that I'm a Christian

371
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,600
and I want grace at the table

372
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,580
and of course, like all young men,

373
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,020
he told her that was fine,

374
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,420
he would be happy to have it

375
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,040
and so there was grace

376
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,460
at the Samuel Clemens table for a while

377
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,360
and one day when she bowed her head

378
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,000
and she prayed,

379
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,240
he looked at her

380
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,460
and with all the vehemence

381
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,960
and the bitterness that he could muster,

382
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,660
he looked at her and he said,

383
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,280
shut up!

384
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I never want to hear it again!

385
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,880
From that day on

386
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,160
in Mark Twain's home,

387
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,140
there was no prayer at the table.

388
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,360
Why?

389
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,820
Because Mark Twain hated God.

390
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,060
It would have been better

391
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,560
they had buried his ridiculous writings

392
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
against God with him.

393
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,120
He was a humorist,

394
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,080
but he was a hater of God.

395
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,540
He never knew the love of God.

396
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
It was not a happy home.

397
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,440
There was no love.

398
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,340
Christian fathers,

399
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,700
when we look at God

400
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,620
and if the heart of God is love

401
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,420
and that means that God yearns

402
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
for the salvation of you and me

403
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,100
regardless of our reaction to him,

404
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,900
it's going to have to be in the home.

405
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,200
And because God has made you and me

406
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,040
as fathers the head of the home,

407
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,260
whether we want to be or not,

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,300
God expects you and me to be like him,

409
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,100
that we shall be godly in love,

410
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,360
that we shall know how to treat our wives

411
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,880
who are the mothers of our children

412
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,460
if the home is going to stand.

413
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
Today is Father's Day

414
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,860
and John the beloved disciple says,

415
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,660
God is love.

416
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,500
Look at God

417
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,320
and he says,

418
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,060
the very heart of God is love.

419
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,500
The very soul of his being is love.

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,520
And that means simply again

421
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,560
that God yearns

422
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,680
and he longs for our eternal welfare,

423
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
never for our eternal loss.

424
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,280
The one thing that God hopes

425
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,020
will never happen to any man

426
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,380
is that a man be lost

427
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,160
regardless of how a man treats him,

428
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,860
regardless of whether a man

429
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,020
tramples him underfoot.

430
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,160
And God has demonstrated

431
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
that kind of love.

432
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,740
He is that kind of a God

433
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
because in the second place,

434
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,800
know this,

435
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,440
that God sent his son

436
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,520
to atone for the sins of the world.

437
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,680
And the world includes

438
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,800
not only those who would be friendly to God,

439
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,560
but it includes also his enemies.

440
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,980
You've got to stand at the cross of Calvary

441
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,520
once in a while,

442
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:54,940
look and say,

443
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,340
for whom did Christ die?

444
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,100
For whom did Jesus,

445
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,740
the son of God on the cross,

446
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,460
bear the guilt

447
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,040
and the punishment

448
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,860
of the world's sin?

449
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,840
Was it just for those

450
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,360
who were going to be friendly to God?

451
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,320
Or did he die for his enemies?

452
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,460
Didn't Jesus say,

453
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,460
one day that scarcely

454
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,020
will a man die for his friends?

455
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,220
But again,

456
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,960
Jesus died for his enemies

457
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,720
while we were yet enemies.

458
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,340
God loved us.

459
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,740
And God sent his only son

460
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,480
into the world.

461
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,440
Jesus Christ died for the guilt

462
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,160
and the punishment

463
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
of the world's sins.

464
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,360
And that includes everybody's.

465
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,700
And you and I may say,

466
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
oh, it seems too good to be true

467
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,200
that God could love

468
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,060
and always yearn for our salvation

469
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,540
and never want our eternal loss.

470
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,860
Listen, at Calvary,

471
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,060
he demonstrated it

472
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,080
because Christ, again,

473
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
that sacrifice of his

474
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,460
was an eternal sacrifice.

475
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,040
He was the lamb slain

476
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,460
from the foundation of the world

477
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,260
that in Jesus Christ

478
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,820
and in his shed blood

479
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,720
there might be provided

480
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,560
for the world

481
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,500
forgiveness, life, and salvation.

482
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,020
Did Christ, by his atonement,

483
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,400
provide the forgiveness of sins

484
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,220
only for a few,

485
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,960
for the friendly,

486
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,540
and not for those

487
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,360
who again trample God underfoot?

488
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,860
That whosoever,

489
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,480
that includes everybody,

490
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,120
doesn't it?

491
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,200
And there is the forgiveness

492
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,720
of sins.

493
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,460
God said,

494
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,420
I am willing to wipe out

495
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,500
of my mind forever

496
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,140
the guilt of all men's sins,

497
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,660
that I will remember them

498
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,180
no more,

499
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,020
that God says,

500
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,700
I'll never even think about them.

501
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,480
I will deliver any man

502
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,080
from death.

503
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,320
I will save any man

504
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,860
for heaven

505
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,820
because my son

506
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,920
on the cross

507
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,180
made those blessings available.

508
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,520
That's the love of God.

509
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,020
And then when you come

510
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,580
to Father's Day

511
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,700
and we say to ourselves

512
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,720
as Christian fathers,

513
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,060
what does God ask of us?

514
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,840
What God asks of us

515
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,380
is this,

516
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,360
if God is love,

517
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,700
that you and I be love.

518
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,860
That means that you and I

519
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,680
be little gods,

520
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,600
that we be like God

521
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,200
in this.

522
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,880
that there will be

523
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,540
a yearning,

524
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,820
a longing,

525
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,940
a real concern

526
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,540
for the eternal good

527
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,340
of all men,

528
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,820
never for the eternal evil

529
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,440
of a man,

530
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,440
regardless of how

531
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,220
he treats us.

532
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,200
And if that would be

533
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
in your life and mine,

534
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,300
then and only then

535
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,880
do we learn

536
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
how to treat our children.

537
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,660
How does a father

538
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,380
treat his children?

539
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,580
Some of us don't know,

540
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,120
do we?

541
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,960
When I was a young lad

542
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,540
in school,

543
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,940
I had some asthma problems

544
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,980
and I went to a doctor

545
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,360
and took a very great

546
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,060
liking to me

547
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,760
and I used to go out

548
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,440
to his home.

549
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,300
He didn't have any children

550
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
and I said to him,

551
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,980
a brilliant man,

552
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,480
you've been with

553
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,580
Mayo Brothers for years.

554
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,400
Finally,

555
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,360
in my own boyish way,

556
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,000
I said to him,

557
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,580
well, Dr. Miller,

558
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,300
how does it come

559
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,060
that you don't have

560
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,540
any children?

561
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,920
He looked at me

562
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,640
quite seriously

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,360
and he said,

564
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,260
because it's too grave

565
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,240
a responsibility

566
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
to be the father

567
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,840
of children,

568
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,960
a brilliant man

569
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
who didn't feel

570
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,100
equal to the task

571
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,640
and I'm sure

572
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,280
that all of us

573
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,700
as parents

574
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,500
have said to ourselves

575
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,020
at times,

576
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,060
who is equal

577
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,900
to the task

578
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,760
of being a parent

579
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,420
for children?

580
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,660
And yet we say,

581
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,400
how do you treat

582
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,040
your children?

583
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,160
If God treats us

584
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,840
in love,

585
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,060
that God ever aims

586
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,240
for our eternal welfare,

587
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,680
then the way

588
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,800
to treat our children

589
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,360
is this,

590
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,140
that at all times,

591
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,420
this is the criterion

592
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,100
and the principle,

593
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,020
that we will treat them

594
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,200
so that we will,

595
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,520
in every way possible,

596
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,300
we will help them

597
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,140
in their way

598
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,540
to heaven

599
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
and never hinder them.

600
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,620
And oh,

601
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,220
that means discipline

602
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,280
to be sure.

603
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,220
Children do not

604
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,540
object to discipline

605
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,380
when it is done

606
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,080
in love

607
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,380
for their eternal welfare.

608
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,460
I can think back

609
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,700
today on Father's Day,

610
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,040
can't you think back

611
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,900
of some of the disciplines

612
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,460
you had?

613
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,100
I think back

614
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,900
of this for instance,

615
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,420
in my home,

616
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,800
I could have

617
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,840
a piece of bread

618
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,420
and butter

619
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,960
anytime I wanted it,

620
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,340
and I could have

621
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,140
a piece of bread

622
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
with jelly on

623
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,600
anytime I wanted it,

624
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
but in my home,

625
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,180
I could never have

626
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,000
a piece of bread

627
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,660
with butter

628
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,580
and jelly.

629
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,840
Never.

630
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,040
Why,

631
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,880
my mother thought

632
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,340
that was extravagance

633
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,360
and so did my father.

634
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,000
I could have

635
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,140
two pieces of bread,

636
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,900
the one with butter

637
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,780
and the other with jelly,

638
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,080
but you never

639
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,800
combined them

640
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,360
in my home.

641
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,160
That's the way I was.

642
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,040
Did I resent it?

643
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,320
No.

644
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
That was extravagance

645
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,780
in my parents' language

646
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,480
and we just

647
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,440
didn't do it.

648
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,760
You talk about

649
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,160
discipline,

650
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,060
I can remember

651
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,460
with my father

652
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,420
was sick in bed

653
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,100
only once

654
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,900
that I can remember

655
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,000
before his death

656
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,080
and it happened

657
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,700
to be a heart attack

658
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,800
and in those days

659
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,440
when a man

660
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
had heart trouble,

661
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,040
the first thing

662
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,100
that he was relieved of

663
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
was the eating of meat.

664
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,880
And I can think back

665
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,140
as a child in my home

666
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,180
the day the doctor said

667
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,980
you can no longer

668
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,580
eat meat

669
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,340
and I remember

670
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,980
the reaction

671
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,660
of my mother,

672
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,800
if father can't eat meat

673
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
there will be no meat

674
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,040
on our table

675
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
and I grew up

676
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,400
through my formative years

677
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,000
in a real vegetarian home.

678
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,860
I didn't know

679
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,180
what meat looked like.

680
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,160
There wasn't any.

681
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,600
My mother said

682
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,180
I will not put meat

683
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,940
on the table

684
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,660
if your father

685
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,480
can't eat it.

686
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,280
We're not going

687
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,720
to eat it either.

688
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,300
We didn't.

689
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,160
I can think back

690
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,680
I suppose

691
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,200
that's why I love meat today.

692
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,380
We didn't resent it

693
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,720
and even bologna

694
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,620
which I kid about

695
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,560
even tastes good.

696
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,200
I don't suppose

697
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll ever get enough meat.

698
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,240
I couldn't have a dog

699
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
when I was a child

700
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,800
but I got one now

701
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,500
but it was a home

702
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,460
of Christian love.

703
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,840
I didn't resent it

704
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,820
because there's got

705
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,780
to be discipline

706
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,820
even as God

707
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,660
disciplines you

708
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,140
and me

709
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,080
and in that love

710
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,780
where there are

711
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,740
Christian fathers

712
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,460
and mothers

713
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,080
where again

714
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,300
there is the aim

715
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,260
to enhance

716
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,860
a child's eternal welfare

717
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,240
and never to jeopardize it

718
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,200
or to endanger it

719
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,300
there's got to be

720
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,860
the discipline

721
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,420
also of Christian training.

722
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,120
If you and I

723
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,680
have come out

724
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,300
of a home

725
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,080
where our parents

726
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,380
brought us to church

727
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,860
we ought to be able

728
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,760
to thank God.

729
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,840
I see no trouble

730
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,420
in homes

731
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,980
when father is along

732
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,700
and I like to look out

733
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,240
in the kind of game

734
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,220
I like to see you men.

735
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,280
People say church

736
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,080
is for old ladies

737
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,680
and children.

738
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,160
It isn't.

739
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,960
It's for men

740
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,280
and I want to see you men.

741
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,380
It's for you fathers

742
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,160
and you fathers

743
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,260
that are here this morning

744
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,020
that have your kids

745
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,880
alongside of you.

746
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,120
Listen.

747
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,800
They're as proud

748
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
as peacocks

749
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,220
of you

750
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,920
and you know it.

751
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,600
You are the hero

752
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,560
of their life.

753
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
As far as I'm concerned

754
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,240
with my children

755
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,820
I want them to love me

756
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,620
not just because

757
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,460
I'm their father

758
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,340
I want them to love me

759
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,860
because I am what I am.

760
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,880
And that's what you want too

761
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,640
isn't that so?

762
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,880
Is there any greater assurance

763
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,800
that your kids

764
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,500
will love you

765
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,460
for what you are?

766
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,500
Accept this

767
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,340
that you have learned

768
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,100
to love them

769
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,600
with the love

770
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,360
that God has

771
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,140
for you and me.

772
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,700
The kind of a love

773
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,360
that you aim

774
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,720
for their eternal welfare

775
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,540
regardless of how

776
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,520
they may treat you

777
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,320
and you never desire

778
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
their eternal loss.

779
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,900
I want men in church

780
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,000
and I want a man

781
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,480
in the pulpit

782
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,200
a man's man

783
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,960
and I don't want anybody

784
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,500
a feminine

785
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,080
a sissy

786
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,320
in the pulpit

787
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
because we want men.

788
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
When men are here

789
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,500
women will be here too.

790
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,340
You talk about

791
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,180
kids loving you

792
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,040
what greater joy

793
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,820
can you have?

794
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,120
Your kids and mine

795
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,100
will love us

796
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,000
if we just treat them

797
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,020
with just a little

798
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,240
half of love

799
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,560
that God has for us.

800
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,920
I think back

801
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,140
with my one child

802
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,800
she was just

803
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,680
four years old

804
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,460
I was studying

805
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,040
one morning

806
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,980
she ran up the stairs

807
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,900
and came in

808
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,780
bright eyed

809
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,140
and said

810
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,700
here daddy

811
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,280
I picked you

812
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,420
a bouquet of flowers

813
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,540
she handed to me

814
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,940
and they were dandelions

815
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,660
but I never got

816
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,760
a grander bouquet

817
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,700
in all my life.

818
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,880
What more

819
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,080
could you ask for

820
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,940
in life

821
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,400
than a bouquet

822
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,060
of flowers

823
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,780
from a child

824
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,840
given in love

825
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,540
because they loved

826
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,500
you as father

827
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,840
they loved you

828
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,500
as daddy

829
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
that's living

830
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,420
isn't it?

831
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,820
Today is Father's Day

832
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,860
and John the beloved

833
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,380
disciple

834
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,280
looked at Jesus

835
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,620
and he looked at God

836
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,400
through the eyes

837
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,880
of Jesus

838
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
and he was able

839
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,500
to write

840
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,660
God is love

841
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,060
and God is love

842
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,820
and that means

843
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,500
in your life

844
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,820
that God ever yearns

845
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,680
and longs for our

846
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,280
eternal wealth

847
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,380
or never for our loss.

848
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,300
God is on the side

849
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,220
of saving us

850
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,140
and there is one thing

851
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,340
that God never wants

852
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,080
to have happen

853
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,660
in your life

854
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,000
and mine

855
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,020
that is that we be lost

856
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,120
regardless of how

857
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,660
we treat him.

858
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:01,980
Why?

859
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,640
Why God demonstrated

860
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,160
that love

861
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,400
because God's love

862
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,600
decreed that any man

863
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,680
that believes in Christ

864
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,340
shall be saved.

865
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
Any man

866
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,680
do you understand that?

867
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,220
Whosoever believeth

868
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,980
in him

869
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,540
that when a man

870
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,200
trusts Jesus Christ

871
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,100
God says

872
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,880
that man

873
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,940
who stands

874
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,580
in sorrow

875
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,420
of his sin

876
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,000
who knows

877
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,680
that he stands

878
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,080
condemned

879
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,000
but who puts

880
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,620
his trust

881
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,860
and his confidence

882
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,880
in the righteousness

883
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,140
of Jesus Christ

884
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,380
God says

885
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
that's the man

886
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,540
that I will save

887
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,840
and that's the man

888
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,820
that I will love

889
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,480
to save

890
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,260
and he didn't

891
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,800
distinguish

892
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,180
and he didn't

893
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,260
separate mankind

894
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,800
and it made no difference

895
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,520
regarding man's color

896
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,280
the color of his skin

897
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,740
or his previous condition

898
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,480
of servitude

899
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,600
God has decreed

900
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,160
in love

901
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,300
that any man

902
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,380
that trusts Jesus

903
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,100
and any man

904
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,760
can do that

905
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,940
shall be saved

906
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,680
and that the joy

907
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,160
of heaven

908
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,140
is this joy

909
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,060
the joy

910
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,700
of a sinner

911
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,460
repenting

912
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,700
Jesus put it this way

913
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,520
there shall be more

914
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,380
joy in heaven

915
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,700
over one sinner

916
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,460
that repenteth

917
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,140
more than over

918
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,060
ninety and nine

919
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,960
just persons

920
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,300
that need

921
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,260
no repentance

922
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,560
christian fathers

923
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,520
god is love

924
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
god says

925
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,960
as I live

926
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,540
saith the lord

927
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,760
I have no pleasure

928
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,400
in the death

929
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,880
of the wicked

930
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,960
but that the wicked

931
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,900
man turn from

932
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,360
his way

933
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,860
and live

934
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,540
if god ever

935
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,940
loves you and me

936
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,640
to the point

937
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,440
that he yearns

938
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
for our salvation

939
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,620
would a million times

940
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,480
rather save us

941
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,900
than to see us lost

942
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,000
then god says

943
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,020
you be loved

944
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,840
when you and I

945
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,660
have learned

946
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,300
to love

947
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,520
as christian fathers

948
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,580
then we're also

949
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,400
going to know

950
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,100
how to treat

951
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,980
those who come

952
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,640
in contact

953
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,300
with us

954
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,180
and with our homes

955
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,000
the united states

956
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,140
is on fire

957
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,620
today

958
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,540
isn't it

959
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,420
oh you can

960
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
laugh it off

961
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:48,880
and you can

962
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,560
chide it off

963
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:49,980
but listen

964
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,420
this thing

965
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,060
of segregation

966
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,000
isn't going

967
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,760
to stop

968
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,220
you know

969
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,560
that's facing

970
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,840
whenever a man

971
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,020
wants liberty

972
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,440
and whenever

973
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,100
a man

974
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,880
regardless of

975
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,320
the color

976
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,040
of his skin

977
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,540
is ready

978
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,320
to die

979
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,960
that he can

980
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,540
have liberty

981
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,900
he is going

982
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,560
to die

983
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,360
or else

984
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,740
don't you ever

985
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,400

986
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
this land

987
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,560

988
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,520
is on fire

989
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,300
it's about

990
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,160
time

991
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,980
we as

992
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,840
christians

993
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,620
begin to show

994
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,360
our colors

995
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,160
god hath

996
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,820
made

997
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,140
all of us

998
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,120
of one blood

999
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,480
it's about

1000
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
time that you

1001
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,180
and i are

1002
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,840
saying that

1003
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,440
all men

1004
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,900
are created

1005
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,260
in the image

1006
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,740
of god

1007
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,520
that a man

1008
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,220
doesn't have

1009
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,860
to die

1010
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,380
to have

1011
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,760
freedom

1012
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,220
in this

1013
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,680
country

1014
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,520
this country

1015
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,440
guarantees

1016
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,380
it to him

1017
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,820
whether you

1018
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,440
and i are

1019
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,980
white or

1020
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,340
whether you

1021
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,840
and i are

1022
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,240
black

1023
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,200
if god

1024
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,160
loved you

1025
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,960
and god

1026
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
loved me

1027
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,500
that god

1028
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,100
would a million

1029
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,860
times rather

1030
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,660
save you

1031
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,100
and me

1032
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,440
even to

1033
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,760
see his

1034
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,100
loss

1035
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
we're

1036
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,900
going to

1037
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,540
have to

1038
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,000
love our

1039
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,400
brother

1040
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,900
we are

1041
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,640
going to

1042
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,400
have to

1043
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,860
love him

1044
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,620
because if

1045
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,200
we say we

1046
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,760
love god

1047
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:02,980
and we

1048
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,240
hate our

1049
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,540
brother

1050
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,820
john says

1051
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,180
we're a

1052
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,640
liar

1053
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,040
then and

1054
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,820
only then

1055
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,320
when we

1056
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,880
love our

1057
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,320
brother

1058
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,380
because god

1059
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,120
loved us

1060
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,820
in spite of

1061
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,060
the way

1062
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,320
we've

1063
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,980
treated him

1064
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,320
then and

1065
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,820
only then

1066
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,180
is this

1067
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,540
going to

1068
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,820
be a

1069
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,100
land

1070
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,560
where all

1071
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,060
men can

1072
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,500
say

1073
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,680
with liberty

1074
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,460
and justice

1075
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,260
for all

1076
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,300
that's

1077
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,780
what this

1078
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,420
land was

1079
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,260
founded on

1080
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,280
and that's

1081
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,760
the greatness

1082
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,220
and the

1083
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,840
genius of

1084
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,460
this land

1085
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,520
that in

1086
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,900
the love

1087
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,420
of god

1088
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,740
we can

1089
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,120
have the

1090
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,480
assurance

1091
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,940
that god

1092
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,520
dwells in

1093
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,880
us

1094
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,700
and that

1095
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,040
we need

1096
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,460
not be

1097
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,940
afraid of

1098
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,420
the judgment

1099
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,100
because that

1100
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,880
kind of love

1101
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,700
will cast out

1102
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,440
any fear

1103
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,740
any trepidation

1104
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,700
about death

1105
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
because if

1106
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,640
we can just

1107
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,400
love our

1108
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,140
fellow man

1109
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,780
in christ

1110
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,540
even as

1111
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,580
god loves

1112
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,180
us

1113
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,620
and hope

1114
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,140
and treat

1115
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,640
a man

1116
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,000
that we

1117
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
might enhance

1118
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
his heavenward

1119
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,040
potentialities

1120
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
rather than

1121
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,780
to thwart

1122
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,340
them

1123
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,520
well then we

1124
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,120
can have the

1125
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,920
assurance that

1126
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,020
god dwells in

1127
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,200
us by faith

1128
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,820
john was the

1129
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,540
beloved disciple

1130
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,160
he had to

1131
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,680
learn oh he

1132
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,100
was just a

1133
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,880
young man in

1134
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,220
his early

1135
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,760
twenties when

1136
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,040

samaritan

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,320
burn up this

1163
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,940
village and

1164
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,060
jesus rather

1165
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,880
smilingly looked

1166
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,320
at him and

1167
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,160
said now son

1168
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,720
of thunder

1169
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,260
bone air

1170
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,680
jesus you

1171
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,100
better hold

1172
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,540
your temper

1173
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,000
he had a

1174
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,160
temper but he

1175
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,680
had to learn

1176
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,300
what it meant

1177
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,880
to be loved

1178
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,620
like god is

1179
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,840
love but in

1180
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,420
the upper room

1181
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:31,880
he had his

1182
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,600
head on jesus

1183
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,440
buzzing remember

1184
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,220
at the cross

1185
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,640
he was the

1186
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,140
only one he

1187
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,680
stood there with

1188
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,940
mary and

1189
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,560
again they

1190
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,520
boiled him in

1191
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,300
oil trying to

1192
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,740
kill him he

1193
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,240
was the only

1194
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,940
disciple that

1195
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,640
died a natural

1196
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,280
death but in

1197
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,700
his old age he

1198
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,760
was the one that

1199
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,580
had penetrated

1200
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,540
closest to the

1201
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,280
heart of christ

1202
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,580
that that's why

1203
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,600
jesus loved him

1204
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,040
the beloved

1205
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,080
disciple he knew

1206
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,660
what it meant

1207
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,100
to love

1208
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
fathers listen

1209
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,420
the world's on

1210
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,000
fire the world

1211
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,920
needs to see

1212
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
demonstrated in

1213
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,440
your life and

1214
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,740
mine the kind

1215
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,320
of love that

1216
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,860
god has

1217
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,900
demonstrated for

1218
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,600
you and me

1219
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,540

the father of

1224
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,900
memory and

1225
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,700
today when i when

1226
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,300
i think of my

1227
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,420
father i think of

1228
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:12,980
the day of my

1229
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,780
ordination when i

1230
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,640
was a child i

1231
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,620
moved from chicago

1232
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,720
to east st louis

1233
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,540
when i graduated

1234
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
from the seminary

1235
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,600
my father wanted

1236
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,560
me ordained back

1237
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,300
in the home church

1238
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,880
in chicago where

1239
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,800
he grew up as a

1240
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,580
boy and where his

1241
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,320
father and my

1242
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,180
mother's father were

1243
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,020
charter members of

1244
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,080
zion lutheran church

1245
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,100
so up to chicago we

1246
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,040
went my father was

1247
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,600
not a very

1248
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
demonstrative type

1249
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,460
of person i

1250
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,120
wondered what he

1251
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,880
would do on the

1252
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,360
day of my

1253
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,400
ordination because

1254
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,260
it had been seven

1255
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,980
years planning to

1256
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,860
go to college and

1257
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,260
seminary and i

1258
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,040
recall when i

1259
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
started he said

1260
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,900
well if there's a

1261
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,560
will there's a way

1262
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,540
we'll manage some

1263
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,300
way and i realized

1264
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,140
what it meant as

1265
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,900
all of you do to

1266
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,720
put someone through

1267
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,860
school but on the

1268
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,620
day of ordination i

1269
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,120
wondered what he

1270
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,840
would do when at

1271
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,480
the end of the

1272
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,420
service i stood

1273
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,020
there and i knew

1274
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,780
people would come

1275
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,520
around and i about

1276
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
had it figured out

1277
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,460
what he would do

1278
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,200
he didn't want to

1279
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,100
show emotion my

1280
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,000
dad walked up to

1281
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,720
me and he shook

1282
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,680
hands with me and

1283
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,060
he just looked at

1284
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,160
me and he wouldn't

1285
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,200
trust to say a

1286
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,360
word because he

1287
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,920
knew that he

1288
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,020
couldn't talk and

1289
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,140
he just looked and

1290
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,560
shook hands and

1291
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,420
bowed his head and

1292
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
walked away in a

1293
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,320
hurry but today i

1294
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,060
think of that

1295
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,040
handshake there was

1296
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,960
everything in it

1297
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,400
that a christian

1298
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,340
father could wish

1299
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,020
for his son there

1300
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,300
was pride and there

1301
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,240
was joy and there

1302
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,340
was a prayer but he

1303
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,380
couldn't show emotion

1304
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,460
and he walked away

1305
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,640
hurriedly that was

1306
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,420
my father for whom i

1307
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,620
have great respect

1308
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,020
and great admiration

1309
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,220
oh when we walk the

1310
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,340
glory road and i like

1311
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,220
to think that when we

1312
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,260
go out of god's house

1313
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,020
on sunday that oh

1314
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,760
if we could just sort

1315
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,840
of walk on there and

1316
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,820
feel we've been with

1317
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,980
god and walk the

1318
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,920

1319
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,420
little joy you know

knowing the love of

1322
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,220
god and having

1323
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,960
experience we could

1324
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,700
just walk the glory

1325
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,680
road and and sing

1326
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,560
with the joy in our

1327
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,980

1328
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,760
love of god but we
