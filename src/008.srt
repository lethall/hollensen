1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,280
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
Let us hear the word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,380
as we find it written in Peter's first letter, the fifth chapter, especially the sixth verse.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,520
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,220
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,140
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,340
In Christ Jesus, the Lord of the nations, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,360
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio,

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,700
today is the third Sunday after Trinity.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:08,100
Today is also the Sunday before July the 4th, which is the birthday of our beloved nation.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:18,720
Next Thursday, our land and nation will celebrate its 187th birthday.

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,880
And as we gather here in God's house this morning, we may say to ourselves,

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,920
does the word of God have a message for America in such a time as this,

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,180
living in this hour in which you and I are living?

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,740
When you and I look out at our nation this morning, and we see its needs, and we see its dangers,

16
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,820
and we realize that we are living in the atomic, the nuclear age, and we are living in the age of outer space,

17
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:57,980
and we say to ourselves, does God have something to say to our nation as we observe its 187th birthday?

18
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,620
And as we turn to the word of God, we find the apostle Peter, the great fisherman from up Galilee way,

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
wrote to the Christians of his day, living under the Roman eagle, living under the Caesars,

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,960
and he had a message for them, and that message is very appropriate and very vital for you and me as Americans

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,860
on this day when we celebrate the birthday of our great nation.

22
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,420
And this is what the apostle Peter told the Christians who were living under the Roman eagle.

23
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,080
He said, humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.

24
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,740
We know that our God is a spirit, therefore God doesn't have a hand,

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,440
and therefore the hand is the symbol of power.

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,880
The mighty hand, therefore, the symbol of almighty, unlimited, omnipotent power.

27
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,220
And so Peter wrote to the Christians of his day, living under the Roman Empire,

28
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,800
humble yourselves under the mighty, the unlimited power of God.

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,040
To humble ourselves means to get on our knees.

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,360
To humble ourselves means to bow.

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,460
It means to stoop.

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,860
And when they say to ourselves, bow in humility, in what way?

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,000
And the apostle Peter tells us, for he says, cast all your care upon him.

34
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,060
In other words, this is the call to America today from the word of God as the apostle Peter speaks,

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:26,360
and that is, humble yourselves in a true confidence, in a true spirit of reliance on the mighty hand of God,

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,420
and trust him all the way through thick and thin.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,320
That's what it means to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,240
And we sophisticated Americans may say to ourselves this morning,

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,140
we are to get on our knees, America, and we are to trust in our God,

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,780
and to trust him all the way with an implicit faith, a faith that knows no ends,

41
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,180
and to trust that mighty, omnipotent, all-powerful hand of his.

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,920
Isn't there a danger if you and I put our trust in the mighty hand of God,

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,280
that we may find ourselves as the bottom man on the totem pole,

44
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,640
or that we may find ourselves out on a limb and somebody may saw the limb off in front of us,

45
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,640
or that you and I may say, we'll have everything to lose and we'll have nothing to gain?

46
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,420
It is well, Americans, as we speak from the word of God this morning

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,160
and celebrate the 187th birthday of our nation,

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
it is well to turn to the word of God and to see,

49
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,400
is God's hand mighty enough to meet our needs?

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,040
Is it mighty enough to meet our dangers?

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,160
Is it mighty enough to supply the things that we in America need today?

52
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,080
Let's look for a moment at the mighty hand of God.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,100
Christian friends, it is just that.

54
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,420
It is that hand that is so mighty, that is so omnipotent,

55
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,600
and that is so all-powerful, that there isn't any need in America today,

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,780
but what the mighty hand of God can meet it,

57
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
and therefore, Peter says, on your knees, America,

58
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,280
trust to the very limit of your confidence,

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,800
the mighty hand of God, because in the first place, look at this mighty hand.

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,840
The mighty hand of God is still the hand that determines the destiny of nations.

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,980
What is it that makes a nation survive, we may say today,

62
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,780
because we have the need of survival in the world, isn't that right?

63
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,320
We may say to ourselves, why, it's the balance of power.

64
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,680
It is having an army, it is having a navy, it is having nuclear weapons, is it?

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,920
Is that the answer that caused the survival of nations,

66
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,960
or does God Almighty have something to do

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,140
with the survival land, the keeping of nations intact,

68
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,060
lest they go down and defeat?

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,460
It wasn't long ago that I was over in the land of Palestine,

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,260
and I came to the place where they said,

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,460
here is where ancient Jericho stood.

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,900
And Christian friends, when you stand in ancient Jericho,

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,480
there's nothing to see on the surface of the land.

74
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,360
They say, this is where we believe the city was.

75
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,580
And do you recall the story when Moses came to Mount Nebo,

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,180
and God allowed him to overlook the land of Canaan

77
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,320
that flowed with milk and honey.

78
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,060
And then Moses died, and God buried him,

79
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,600
and Joshua came into command.

80
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,740
And when Joshua, with the children of Israel,

81
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,780
crossed the river Jordan and came into the land of Canaan,

82
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,080
the first city that they were to take was the city of Jericho.

83
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
And you remember how they took it?

84
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,500
God said that there shall be the priests who shall take the trumpets,

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,940
and they shall march around the city of Jericho

86
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,220
once each day for six days.

87
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,180
And then God said, on the seventh day,

88
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
they shall march around the city seven times.

89
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,740
And when they have done that on the seventh time,

90
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,020
they shall blow their trumpets.

91
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,320
And when the people hear the blow of the trumpet,

92
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,460
they shall shout at the top of their voices.

93
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,960
And God says, the walls of Jericho will come down.

94
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,000
Did they come down?

95
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,560
I stood at the place where they said Jericho was,

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,820
and archaeologists have begun to dig there.

97
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,520
And they have dug down 70 feet in the earth's surface.

98
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,780
And down 70 feet they have uncovered a city

99
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,740
that they say, these are the ruins of ancient Jericho.

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,420
Does a nation survive by its own power,

101
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,460
or does a nation survive because it puts its trust

102
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,220
in the mighty hand of God?

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,240
Then you remember there was King Hezekiah,

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,600
who was king of the southern kingdom.

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,960
And when again Sennacherib had come,

106
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,980
the man that surrounded the city was going to take it.

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,460
That night Hezekiah, knowing that he was

108
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,200
woefully outdistanced in power,

109
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,920
he prayed to God and asked God for help.

110
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,140
And there came a plague in the night,

111
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,420
if you recall that incident.

112
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,400
And the next morning there were 185,000 dead Assyrians

113
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
lying around the city of Jerusalem.

114
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,960
The mighty hand of God determines the destinies of nations.

115
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,440
Oh, not that we are not to use our judgment,

116
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,500
and not that we are not to be armed to defend ourselves.

117
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,220
But again, America, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Nations stand by the power of God,

119
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,600
not because of the balance of power of men.

120
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,000
And when again the northern kingdom had sinned against God

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
in the year 722,

122
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,060
and Shalmaneser came,

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,760
he carried ten tribes of Israel off into captivity,

124
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,320
and they had been wiped off the face of the earth,

125
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,880
the famous lost ten tribes.

126
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,960
Why? Because they forgot God.

127
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,980
And then came the year 586 before Christ,

128
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,500
when Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean came and sacked the city of Jerusalem

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,860
and carried the Jews away into captivity down in Babylon.

130
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,240
But you recall there was a prophet Isaiah

131
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
that lived 700 years before Jesus,

132
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,520
who had prophesied over 100 years before the man came into existence,

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,740
that there would be a man by the name of Cyrus,

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,060
and that that man would release the Jews,

135
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,500
and they would be allowed to come back from their home in Babylon

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,060
and to go back and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem

137
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,740
and come back into Palestine.

138
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,020
And that night at Belshazzar's feast down in Babylon,

139
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,080
oh, the Babylonian army was intense and it was terrific,

140
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,840
but because there was drunkenness and debauchery,

141
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,200
that night the Medes and the Persians broke in,

142
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,340
and they overcame the Chaldeans,

143
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
and Cyrus came on the throne,

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,100
and the Jews came back.

145
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,140
Why the almighty power of God

146
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,860
and come up to this last war, World War II.

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,960
Why was it that Hitler and his Nazi power,

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,460
why was it that they stopped

149
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,140
when they had England on its knees?

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,860
Even Winston Churchill couldn't understand.

151
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,340
What was it that made him stop

152
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,820
when there was no resistance?

153
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,660
But he stopped.

154
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,240
And the very fate of World War II was changed.

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Why?

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,860
Because God Almighty,

157
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,640
the mighty hand of God,

158
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,380
still determines the destinies of nations.

159
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,280
And therefore, when the call to you and me

160
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,140
as we celebrate the 187th birthday of our glorious land,

161
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,720
it ought to be America on its knees

162
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,260
that we trust in God

163
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,920
and we go all the way into our trust,

164
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,260
because having God

165
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,020
and trusting the mighty hand of God,

166
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,960
nothing will ever happen to this nation.

167
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,300
Except the Lord God allows it to come.

168
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,560
That's the assurance that we can have as Christians

169
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,620
when we humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.

170
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,820
And as we observe the birthday, therefore,

171
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,320
of our glorious nation today,

172
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,380
we ought to look inside and probe within ourselves

173
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,520
to see whether we really trust God.

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,220
Does this nation really trust God?

175
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,900
Are we a trusting people in Almighty God

176
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,320
and in His mighty hand?

177
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
You know, some of us may look with the stance

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,940
of that question this morning.

179
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,660
We may say we are disappointed

180
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,440
because of the recent decisions

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,940
of the United States Supreme Court

182
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,560
with regard to the schools

183
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,380
legislating the reading of the Bible

184
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,740
or the praying of the Lord's Prayer in school.

185
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,660
You know, I am proud of my nation

186
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,440
that the Supreme Court gave that ruling.

187
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,860
We must understand that the Supreme Court

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
did not say that we were not a believing,

189
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,420
a religious people,

190
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,440
but because this is a nation

191
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
where you and I have the freedom of conscience

192
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,580
to worship our God,

193
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
and that means that you can worship

194
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,780
the way he would worship.

195
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,060
That means that the atheist who refuses

196
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,260
to believe that there is a God

197
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,700
can worship as he would want to.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,580
That means that the Roman Catholic,

199
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,700
the Lutheran, the Protestant,

200
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,300
can worship his way,

201
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,720
and all in our government,

202
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,300
all that the Supreme Court said.

203
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,440
That schools shall not legislate a religion.

204
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,520
That shall be left to the individual.

205
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,980
That shall be left to the church.

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,060
I was in Israel, in Haifa,

207
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,300
and in the Zion Hotel,

208
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,400
in a Jewish hotel.

209
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,360
And again, it was the first meal

210
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
that we had had that was a good one

211
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
for many a week.

212
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
And yet we sat there,

213
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,300
and it was a lovely meal.

214
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,800
It was beef, to be sure.

215
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,440
And I had coffee,

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,740
and I asked for cream,

217
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,620
and I knew when I asked for it

218
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,640
that I probably would not get it

219
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,760
because I was with an Orthodox group.

220
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,160
And again, the waiter said to me,

221
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,880
I am sorry,

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
but you will have cream

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,220
tomorrow morning for breakfast.

224
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,360
I knew the ancient ceremony

225
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
of Jewish law

226
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,520
that forbade a Jew to eat meat

227
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,320
and to drink cream

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,460
within an eight-hour period.

229
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,720
Yet I was a Gentile.

230
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,580
Yet again, even though I was a Gentile,

231
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,420
there was no cream on the table,

232
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
and no Gentile would have it

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,500
because no Jew would mix meat and milk

234
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,820
within an eight-hour period.

235
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,960
In our great land

236
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
where we have religious freedom,

237
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,540
again, if the Roman Catholic

238
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,040
would come into ascendancy

239
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,380
and would legislate religion,

240
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,520
it could well be that on Friday

241
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,600
no meat would be sold

242
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,720
in any grocery store.

243
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,400
We would have to eat fish.

244
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,540
And again, with regard to the Jew,

245
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,420
that cream and milk and meat

246
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,540
would not go together,

247
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,220
or even as regards

248
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,240
the Lutheran Church,

249
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,660
if we were in the ascendancy,

250
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,460
there would be a danger

251
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,940
that we might want

252
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,780
the very taxable money

253
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,400
of the nation

254
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
to go for the furtherance

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
of the Lutheran Church,

256
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,260
and we would not want that.

257
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,040
There is corruption

258
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,340
wherever there is power.

259
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,080
I thank God for a nation

260
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,900
that still stands

261
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,220
for freedom of religion

262
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,500
and says,

263
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,080
you are the ones to decide

264
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,380
what your religion shall be,

265
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,320
your church shall decide,

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
the government shall not interfere,

267
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,120
as you carry out your prerogative

268
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,580
to worship God

269
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,980
as your conscience would dictate.

270
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,700
It's a great nation

271
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,560
and I love it.

272
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,000
And therefore, again,

273
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
as Peter would speak

274
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,320
to the people of his day,

275
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,320
and you and I,

276
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,620
as we celebrate the birthday

277
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,040
of our great land,

278
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,400
we say,

279
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,480
does God have a message?

280
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:28,920
Yes.

281
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,140
Humble yourselves

282
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,100
under the mighty hand of God.

283
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,820
Humble yourselves,

284
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,420
America, on your knees.

285
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,860
bow the knee

286
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,300
with a real confident faith

287
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,640
and trust and reliance

288
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,740
and go all the way

289
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,700
in your trust

290
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,280
in the mighty,

291
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,660
omnipotent hand of God.

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,600
And we can say,

293
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
but is God's hand powerful enough

294
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,100
that God's hand can do something

295
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,640
as regards this nation?

296
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,980
Well, look in the second place.

297
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,160
Not only does God's hand

298
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,260
guide and determine

299
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,620
the destinies of nations,

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,480
but God's mighty hand

301
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
also determines

302
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,880
and holds in check Satan,

303
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
who is again

304
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,580
the roaring lion.

305
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,980
You recall when

306
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,400
Dick read the epistle lesson,

307
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,960
he said,

308
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,440
Peter had these words,

309
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
be sober, be vigilant,

310
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,760
because your adversary,

311
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,320
the devil,

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,980
as a roaring lion,

313
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,860
walketh about,

314
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,260
seeking whom he may devour.

315
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
This individual Satan,

316
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,180
this fallen angel of God,

317
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,900
he is depicted in two lights

318
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,780
in the word of God.

319
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,920
One is this,

320
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,600
his stealth,

321
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,180
that he comes in temptation

322
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,020
to you and me,

323
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,460
and by enticing us

324
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,580
to do that which is wrong,

325
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,720
to get us to fall away

326
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,900
from a living faith

327
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,760
in Jesus Christ

328
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,860
as our Lord and Savior.

329
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,080
But he's got another side,

330
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,180
and the other side

331
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,740
is the side of the roaring lion,

332
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,380
the ravenously hungry lion

333
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,220
that we are told

334
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,660
raves and roars

335
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,480
when it's hungry,

336
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,520
about to devour its prey.

337
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,280
Satan has that side of him,

338
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,720
and that's the side

339
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,520
of persecution.

340
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
When Satan cannot win

341
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,500
you and me

342
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:53,860
by enticement,

343
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,440
the next best bet he has

344
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,540
is to win you and me

345
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,000
by bringing persecution.

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,640
And when Peter was writing here,

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,180
he wasn't writing something

348
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,980
that was a theory.

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Something had already

350
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,860
taken place.

351
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,260
Nero was emperor in Rome,

352
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,420
and you recall that he had

353
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,860
set fire to the city of Rome,

354
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
and when this thing boomeranged,

355
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,680
he was blamed for it.

356
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
And in order to take

357
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,700
and shift the blame

358
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,540
to someone else,

359
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,540
why here was again

360
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,000
the dupe,

361
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,820
those Christians,

362
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,020
those new people,

363
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,260
who were worshipping

364
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,680
a Jesus who was crucified,

365
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,040
who were worshipping

366
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,220
a Jesus that they said

367
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,400
arose again from the dead,

368
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
and he blamed it on them.

369
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,700
And then the Neronian persecutions

370
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,660
broke out,

371
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,340
and Christians were devoured

372
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,000
by lions in the Colosseum

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,980
in which I stood

374
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,960
and thought back

375
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,460
of the time

376
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,840
when those things took place.

377
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,700
The roaring lion began.

378
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
And we say to ourselves,

379
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,480
well, does God control

380
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,380
the roaring lion?

381
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,580
After all,

382
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,060
it's true that in the last

383
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,660
30 years,

384
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,220
think of it,

385
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,660
in the last 30 years

386
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,820
there have been more Christians

387
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,440
put to death

388
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
because of their faith

389
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,640
than there have been

390
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,620
from the day of Jesus

391
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,960
until 30 years ago.

392
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,440
There are millions

393
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
behind the Iron Curtain

394
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
who are still in salt mines

395
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,720
and who are in subjection

396
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,000
and in subjugation

397
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,400
because of this crime

398
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,960
that they dare to confess

399
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,920
that Jesus Christ

400
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,660
is their Lord

401
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,340
and their Savior from sin.

402
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,060
And what may a person say?

403
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Well, if God Almighty

404
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,340
has a mighty hand,

405
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,320
what is his power?

406
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,800
We must go back

407
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,480
to Calvary.

408
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
Jesus Christ conquered

409
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,020
Satan on the cross,

410
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,400
and when he arose again

411
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,980
from the dead,

412
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,640
Jesus said,

413
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,880
I saw que Satan

414
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,300
topple from his throne.

415
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,900
God Almighty

416
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,400
in this day of choice

417
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,620
still controls Satan

418
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,760
even though

419
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,640
he is still

420
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,720
the roaring lion.

421
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,900
God still controls him.

422
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,180
The church of Jesus Christ

423
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,620
is here,

424
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,000
and we say,

425
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,660
why does God

426
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,360
allow persecution?

427
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,680
Well, you see,

428
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
it accomplishes some good.

429
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,660
If persecution

430
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,780
would come to your land

431
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,760
and mine today,

432
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,000
how many of us

433
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,860
would stand up

434
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,800
for a true loyalty

435
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,740
in Jesus Christ

436
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
and face death?

437
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,560
You see,

438
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,160
there's one thing

439
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,040
that persecution does.

440
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,320
It cleanses the church.

441
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:50,920
You know,

442
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,520
the church gets

443
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,880
so top-heavy at times.

444
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,780
We join it

445
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,260
like we would

446
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,800
a lodge

447
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,560
or an organization

448
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,720
and we pay dues

449
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,280
and we expect

450
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,120
to be waited on.

451
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,240
We forget

452
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,380
the balm of Gilead,

453
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,120
Jesus Christ,

454
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,700
in the church.

455
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,600
We forget

456
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,500
that when we come in,

457
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,400
this is a hospital

458
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,700
for sin-sick souls.

459
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,580
We forget

460
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,380
that we come in

461
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,040
with the guilt

462
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,780
of damnation

463
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,580
on ourselves,

464
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
and we forget

465
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
that we come

466
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
to hear the glorious

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,160
good news

468
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,920
that the blood

469
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,800
of Jesus Christ

470
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,820
can cleanse a man

471
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,660
whiter than snow,

472
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,700
that he can stand

473
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,380
before the bar

474
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,320
of divine justice

475
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,520
and be a forgiven sinner.

476
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,300
We forget it.

477
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,140
And again,

478
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,920
the church becomes

479
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,800
a social status.

480
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
We belong to the church

481
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,120
where the best people go.

482
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,500
And when persecution comes,

483
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,420
we run,

484
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,900
unless there is

485
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,160
a living confrontation

486
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
of Jesus Christ.

487
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,680
It cleanses the church.

488
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,380
And another thing it does,

489
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,540
it increases the faith

490
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,480
of those who believe,

491
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,720
that we finally learn

492
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,240
to realize

493
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,160
that there's only one thing

494
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
important in this world,

495
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,180
and it isn't money,

496
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,980
it isn't stature,

497
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,820
it isn't status,

498
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,500
it is Jesus Christ.

499
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,860
And the other thing

500
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,260
is this,

501
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,740
you know it,

502
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,300
and so do I,

503
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,060
there are some people

504
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,460
in this world

505
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,360
who will never be one

506
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,880
for Christ,

507
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,980
except they see

508
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,220
somebody die for him.

509
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,760
There's one thing

510
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,700
that is unanswerable.

511
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,740
When a man says

512
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,980
somebody else was willing

513
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,280
to die and to be killed

514
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,020
for his faith,

515
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
then a living faith

516
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,100
in Jesus Christ

517
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,400
must be a vital necessity,

518
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,740
and it must be

519
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,760
an essential land,

520
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,080
the blood of martyrs.

521
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,640
It becomes the seed

522
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,360
of the church,

523
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,940
because through that seed

524
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,760
the church grows.

525
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,860
And so God Almighty

526
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,960
still controls it,

527
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,100
and we know this,

528
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,680
that when we,

529
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
in America,

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,580
we're on our knees,

531
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,460
and we come into

532
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,560
a real reliance,

533
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,440
and go all the way

534
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,540
in the mighty hand of God,

535
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,100
that if it would come,

536
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,260
God Almighty promises

537
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,280
you and me strength

538
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
to sustain us,

539
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,460
that we can stand

540
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,400
and quit ourselves

541
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,900
as Christians ought to be.

542
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,860
Today,

543
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
as we realize

544
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,920
that we're celebrating

545
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,720
the 187th birthday

546
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,960
of our glorious nation,

547
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,300
if persecution should come,

548
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
let us accept it gladly,

549
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,280
and know that it was

550
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,900
not something

551
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,740
that was inevitable,

552
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,100
it was something

553
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,060
that God allowed

554
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,720
to come,

555
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,160
relying upon God's strength.

556
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:49,980
Yesterday,

557
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,220
June the 29th,

558
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,000
and the ancient church

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,100
was always celebrated

560
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,240
as St. Peter

561
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
and St. Paul's Day,

562
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,820
commemorating their martyrdom.

563
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,340
Peter knew

564
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,300
what he was writing about

565
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,980
in the Neronian persecution.

566
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,300
He was brought to Rome,

567
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,740
and he was crucified

568
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,080
upside down.

569
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,960
He was crucified

570
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,620
because he was a Jew,

571
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
and he lost his life

572
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,380
because he dared

573
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,080
to be a soldier

574
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,980
of Jesus Christ.

575
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,860
And there was Paul,

576
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,800
the little Jew

577
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,900
from up Tarsus Way

578
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,400
in Cilicia,

579
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
when he was brought to Rome

580
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,600
because he was

581
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,360
a Roman citizen.

582
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,060
He was given the choice

583
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,600
and therefore

584
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,680
they beheaded him.

585
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,300
That's the way Romans died.

586
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,640
His head fell

587
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
from his shoulders.

588
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,420
But Paul was a man

589
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,120
that could say,

590
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,140
I have fought a good fight,

591
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,400
I have finished the course,

592
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,520
I have kept the faith.

593
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,380
Henceforth,

594
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,340
there is laid up for me

595
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,360
a crown of righteousness,

596
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,340
which the Lord,

597
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,140
the righteous judge,

598
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,220
who give me at that day,

599
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,340
and not to me only,

600
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
but to all them also

601
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,420
that love is appearing.

602
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,460
Those men died

603
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,660
because they humbled themselves

604
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,360
under the mighty hand of God,

605
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,320
and they knew

606
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,220
that God's hand

607
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,040
was mighty enough

608
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,960
to protect them,

609
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,940
except when God used them

610
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,240
to the glory of his name.

611
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,140
Today,

612
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,980
as we celebrate again

613
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,460
the birthday

614
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,620
of our great nation,

615
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,220
humble yourselves,

616
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,980
says Peter,

617
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,160
down on your knees,

618
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,640
America,

619
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,680
trust God,

620
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,520
trust him all the way.

621
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,340
You and I say,

622
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,480
will we be disappointed?

623
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,980
Bear in mind,

624
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,320
the mighty hand of God

625
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,140
is also this mighty hand

626
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,540
that will exalt

627
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,700
and that will abase

628
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,680
in due time.

629
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,820
Will there be a judgment?

630
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,260
Peter said,

631
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,320
humble yourselves,

632
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,700
therefore,

633
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,100
under the mighty hand of God

634
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,320
that he may exalt you

635
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
in due time.

636
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,420
Will there be a judgment day

637
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,400
when God's Christ will come?

638
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,080
You know,

639
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,880
sometimes men laugh at it.

640
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,140
Will there be a day

641
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,040
of exaltation

642
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,960
for God's own?

643
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,240
Have you ever noticed

644
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,420
as you read the Old Testament

645
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,320
the number of times

646
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,020
it is mentioned

647
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,380
about the children of Israel

648
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,040
being delivered

649
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,100
from the land of Egypt?

650
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,420
How again,

651
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,560
when Moses led them

652
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,400
an army of between

653
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,700
one and three million Jews

654
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,040
and they crossed the Red Sea

655
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,800
and they came into

656
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,380
the wilderness

657
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,000
and God kept them alive

658
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
by manna that fell

659
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,240
from heaven for 40 years

660
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,180
and we are told

661
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,760
that their feet

662
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,400
didn't swell

663
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,060
and their clothing

664
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,780
didn't wear out

665
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,660
in that 40-year period.

666
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,680
And they came

667
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,200
into the land of Canaan

668
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,040
and that great deliverance

669
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,160
again stands

670
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,300
as a monumental deliverance

671
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,660
that is going to take place

672
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,560
at the last day.

673
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,000
Will there be a debasement

674
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,460
of those

675
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,940
that have rejected Jesus Christ?

676
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,220
There was the flood

677
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,460
that inundated the world.

678
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,100
It stands

679
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,380
as a testimony of judgment.

680
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,780
There was the destruction

681
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,900
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

682
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,640
It stands

683
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
as a testimony of judgment.

684
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,420
There was again

685
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,080
the destruction

686
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,720
of Jerusalem

687
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,660
in the year 70

688
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,360
when Titus and Vespasian

689
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,180
sacked the city.

690
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,060
It stands

691
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,980
as destruction.

692
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,220
God will exalt

693
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,620
and God will abase.

694
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,140
Even Christ said

695
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,160
this generation

696
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,240
of this race

697
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,160
shall not pass away

698
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,220
till all be fulfilled.

699
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,060
The fact that the Jew

700
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,900
will live

701
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,380
to the end of time

702
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,060
is an absolute

703
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,640
ocular demonstration

704
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
of this promise

705
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,380
of God

706
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,680
that God

707
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,780
will come again

708
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,960
in exaltation

709
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,060
and God

710
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,700
will come

711
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,520
to dethrone

712
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,340
those who have

713
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,240
rejected Him.

714
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,220
And therefore

715
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,460
we face a problem

716
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,220
today

717
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,580
and in our nation

718
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,460
it's the problem

719
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,540
of the colored people

720
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,120
isn't it?

721
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,500
And we say to ourselves

722
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,400
what is the will

723
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,960
of God?

724
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,360
Some men

725
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,620
are not interested

726
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,940
in what the will

727
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,920
of God is

728
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,400
because they

729
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,420
do not believe

730
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,060
in the mighty

731
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,500
hand of God

732
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,320
to destroy.

733
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,060
But God's arm

734
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,080
will exalt

735
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,400
and it will abase.

736
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,200
What is the will

737
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,920
of God?

738
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
God has made

739
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,600
all men

740
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,360
in His image

741
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,060
hasn't He?

742
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,420
Adam and Eve

743
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,680
were our first parents

744
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,240
and all human beings

745
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,660
therefore

746
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,860
are made

747
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,400
in the image

748
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,020
of God

749
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,620
regardless

750
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,660
as to the fact

751
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,140
as to whether

752
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,040
a man's color

753
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,720
is white

754
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,540
or whether

755
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,200
his color

756
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
is colored.

757
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,580
There is only

758
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,880
one kind

759
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,900
of human blood

760
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,680
and it flows

761
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,520
through the veins

762
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,460
of all men

763
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,140
doesn't it?

764
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,700
What is the will

765
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,360
of God

766
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,060
as we stand

767
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
in our nation

768
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,340
that is on fire?

769
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,400
Let's realize this

770
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,340
that we ought

771
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,880
to say

772
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,060
if God Almighty

773
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,900
will come

774
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
to exalt

775
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,660
and condemn

776
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,520
we ought to pray

777
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,300
on our knees

778
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,600
today

779
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,520
God give us

780
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,200
the courage

781
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
to do what is right

782
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,880
regardless

783
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,060
of what the consequences

784
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,660
will be.

785
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,720
There was Abraham Lincoln

786
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,360
who stood

787
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,520
on the battlefield

788
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,620
of Gettysburg

789
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,280
and he spoke

790
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,200
these monumental

791
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
words one day

792
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,360
fourscore

793
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,000
and seven years ago

794
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
our fathers

795
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,380
brought forth

796
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,420
on this continent

797
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,360
a new nation

798
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,400
conceived in liberty

799
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
and dedicated

800
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,800
to the proposition

801
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,380
that all men

802
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,600
are created equal.

803
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,760
A score

804
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,200
you know

805
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,320
is twenty years

806
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,520
fourscore

807
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,300
would be eighty

808
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,920
wouldn't it?

809
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,500
Eighty plus seven

810
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,240
means 87 years.

811
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,580
So when

812
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,760
Abraham Lincoln

813
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,340
stood at

814
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,600
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

815
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
where fifty one

816
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
thousand Americans

817
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,300
either died

818
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,900
or were wounded

819
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,560
in battle

820
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,420
it was at the time

821
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,100
when our nation

822
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,700
was just

823
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,620
eighty seven

824
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,680
years old.

825
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,240
This coming

826
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,980
Thursday

827
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,760
our nation

828
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,460
under God

829
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,120
will be

830
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,200
one hundred

831
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,580
and eighty

832
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,640
seven

833
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,620
years old.

834
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,640
One hundred

835
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,520
years.

836
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,860
the colored

837
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,720
people have

838
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,160
waited

839
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,640
for their

840
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,200
rights

841
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
which are

842
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,920
theirs

843
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,020
by constitution

844
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,080
and by law

845
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,220
in this

846
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,100
great land

847
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,860
of ours.

848
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,300
How much

849
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,540
more patience

850
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,860
do you

851
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,420
and I

852
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,060
want

853
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,800
from them?

854
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,580
We teach

855
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,660
our children

856
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,320
do we not

857
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,840
that they are

858
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,580
to stand

859
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,420
in the classroom

860
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,580
and to place

861
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,360
their hand

862
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,000
on their

863
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,400
heart

864
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,040
and to face

865
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,680
O glory

866
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,140
and to pledge

867
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,600
allegiance

868
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
and we thrill

869
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,300
when we hear

870
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
them stand

871
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,420
and say

872
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,040
I pledge

873
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,440
allegiance

874
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,340
to the flag

875
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,840
of the United

876
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,460
States of

877
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,900
America

878
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,160
and to the

879
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,600
republic

880
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,080
for which

881
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,900
it stands

882
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,060
one nation

883
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,180
under God

884
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,700
indivisible

885
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,320
with liberty

886
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,660
and justice

887
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,880
for all.

888
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,020
But listen

889
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,580
Americans

890
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,200
how many

891
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,720
children

892
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,540
stand in

893
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,100
the classroom

894
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,460
and under

895
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,920
their breath

896
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,280
have got

897
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,820
to say

898
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,300
with liberty

899
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,520
and justice

900
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,580
for all

901
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,200
but me.

902
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,700
we teach

903
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,420
our children

904
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,180
to stand

905
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,760
in church

906
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,260
and there's

907
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,680
the church

908
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,260
flag over

909
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,700
there

910
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,020
and to put

911
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,700
their hands

912
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,160
over their

913
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,540
hearts

914
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:22,940
and to say

915
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,500
I pledge

916
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,900
allegiance

917
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,460
to the

918
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,960
Christian

919
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,540
flag

920
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,640
and to

921
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,140
the church

922
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,580
for which

923
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,480
it stands

924
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,500
one

925
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,180
savior

926
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,140
universal

927
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,040
with life

928
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,120
and salvation

929
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,820
for all.

930
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,300
Do you

931
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,900
believe

932
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,760
life

933
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,680
and salvation

934
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,520
in Jesus

935
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
Christ

936
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,780
have been

937
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,400
prepared

938
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,420
for all?

939
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,020
Does that

940
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,700
mean the

941
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,540
colored man

942
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,000
as well

943
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,420
as the

944
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,060
white man

945
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,460
or are we

946
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,240
living a lie?

947
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,580
Do you

948
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:52,920
and I

949
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,680
believe it?

950
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,320
If we

951
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,460
believe it

952
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,320
when will

953
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,860
be as

954
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,380
Americans

955
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,920
and as

956
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,380
Christians

957
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,940
say

958
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,440
this thing

959
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,820
has gone

960
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,420
on long

961
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,800
enough?

962
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,760
The ground

963
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,320
before the

964
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,760
cross of

965
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,160
Calvary

966
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,740
is level

967
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,120
and it's

968
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,420
equal.

969
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,820
God

970
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,400
hath made

971
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
us all

972
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,580
of one

973
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,060
blood.

974
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,860
that men

975
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,600
may have

976
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,120
the liberty

977
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,280
that this

978
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,080
great nation

979
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,940
intends for

980
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,300
all.

981
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,360
Francis Scott

982
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,120
Key, you

983
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,800
know, asked

984
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,720
the question,

985
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,780
oh say can

986
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,880
you see by

987
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
the dawn's

988
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,420
early light

989
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,020
what so proudly

990
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,000
we hailed at

991
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,980
the twilight's

992
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,860
last gleaming?

993
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,400
He asked the

994
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,260
question, can

995
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,620
you still see

996
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,400
in the dawn

997
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,940
something that

998
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,320
we saw in

999
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,160
the twilight

1000
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,320
last night?

1001
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:41,480
And you

1002
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,860
and I

1003
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,380
may say

1004
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,940
what did

1005
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,120
Francis Scott

1006
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,160
Key see?

1007
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,820
And then he

1008
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,420
goes on

1009
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,380
whose broad

1010
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,300
stripes and

1011
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
bright stars

1012
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,780
through the

1013
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,720
perilous night

1014
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,740
or the

1015
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,900
ramparts we

1016
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,500
watched

1017
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,680
were so

1018
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
gallantly

1019
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
streaming?

1020
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,600
He was

1021
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,100
looking at

1022
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,200
Fort McHenry

1023
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,700
he calls it

1024
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
the stripes

1025
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,380
and the stars.

1026
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,680
It was

1027
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
gallantly

1028
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,160
waving

1029
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,300
and they

1030
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,820
could see

1031
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,220
it through

1032
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,020
the night

1033
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,040
and we

1034
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,580
wonder how

1035
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:11,940
could he

1036
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,340
see it

1037
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,700
through the

1038
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,060
night?

1039
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:13,840
But he

1040
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,360
goes on

1041
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,900
and says

1042
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,460
in the

1043
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,080
rocket's

1044
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,840
red glare

1045
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,520
the bombs

1046
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,100
bursting

1047
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,660
into air

1048
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,400
gave proof

1049
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,740
through the

1050
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,140
night

1051
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,340
that our

1052
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,000
flag

1053
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,680
was still

1054
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,080
there.

1055
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,620
That's what

1056
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,300
it was.

1057
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,860
Oh glory.

1058
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,260
When the

1059
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,200
bombs burst

1060
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,660
into air

1061
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,600
Francis Scott

1062
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:30,980
Key

1063
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,460
could still

1064
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,820
see

1065
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,560
Oh glory

1066
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,160
waving in

1067
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,940
the breeze.

1068
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,320
Then he

1069
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,100
asks America

1070
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,000
this question

1071
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,940
today as we

1072
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,780
commemorate the

1073
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,400
birthday of our

1074
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,680
nation.

1075
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,400
Oh say

1076
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,020
does that

1077
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,260
star-spangled

1078
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,280
banner yet

1079
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,920
wave

1080
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,600
for the land

1081
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,420
of the free

1082
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,540
and the home

1083
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,460
of the brave?

1084
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,080
Does it

1085
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,400
still wave?

1086
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,860
Is it

1087
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
going to

1088
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,980
continue to

1089
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,500
wave?

1090
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,620
Oh only if

1091
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,480
America gets

1092
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,640
on its knees

1093
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,980
only if

1094
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,580
America

1095
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,200
humbles

1096
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,620
itself

1097
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,280
before the

1098
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,600
mighty

1099
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,120
end of

1100
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,540
God

1101
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,520
and dares

1102
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,120
to do

1103
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,840
what God

1104
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,420
wants it

1105
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,960
to do

1106
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,380
only then

1107
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:14,880
can the

1108
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,440
words that

1109
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,160
Abraham Lincoln

1110
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,100
spoke come

1111
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,560
true

1112
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,320
as he prayed

1113
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,800
that all

1114
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,660
this nation

1115
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,200
of the

1116
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,580
people

1117
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,100
and by

1118
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,880
the people

1119
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,600
and for

1120
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,520
the people

1121
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,320
should not

1122
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,880
perish

1123
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,320
from the

1124
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,680
earth.

1125
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,020
I love

1126
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,620

too.

1131
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,020
We love

1132
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,280
it that

1133
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,620
we would

1134
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,180
die for

1135
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,480
it.

1136
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,000
Today as

1137
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
we commemorate

1138
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,600

187th

Quit

Amen.
