1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,620
Let us hear the word of God, our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,620
as we find it written in Paul's letter to the Romans, beginning there in the sixth chapter,

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,060
especially the third verse.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:26,080
Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,580
were baptized into his death.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,460
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,100
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,920
In Christ Jesus, the Lord of our Christian life,

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,940
dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,120
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,440
Today, as you know, is the sixth Sunday after the Festival of Trinity.

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,040
It is our custom on these After Trinity Sundays

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,360
to deal with some of the common and practical problems of our Christian life and conduct.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,220
You recall that last Sunday we talked about getting along with one another,

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,300
how to live in peace and harmony with one another.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,120
And today we have a very practical thing that we want to talk about,

18
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,180
and that is the matter of carelessness in our Christian life.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,760
I like to call it sloppy Christian living.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,360
Sloppy Christian living.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,560
This kind of living where we're off the beam.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,740
We're either always to the left or we're always to the right,

23
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,200
but in our Christian life, it is a sloppy thing.

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,800
It's a careless thing.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,220
It is an inferior thing.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,340
It is a Christian life that is not becoming us as Christians.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,580
And you know, friends, it's a very easy thing

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,820
to slip into a sloppy Christian life, isn't it?

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,700
It's very easy to look at our life

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,000
and to not care whether we are doing the will of God

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,640
or whether we are not doing it.

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,800
Not to care whether as we look at our life

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,140
that it's a soggy thing

34
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,420
and that it's something that we are rather ashamed of.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,640
And it may all come very easily from this thing

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,980
that we say something like this to ourselves.

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,280
Now we are saved by the forgiving grace of God, are we not?

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,940
And that's true, isn't it?

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,920
We are saved by the grace of God

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,660
and that means that you and I are not saved by our life.

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,540
Isn't that right?

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,560
And because we are saved by the forgiving grace of God

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,940
and that our lives do not save us,

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
it's the easiest thing in the world,

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,220
especially for us Lutherans,

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,000
to get the idea that life, therefore, is not very important.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,420
Because if life doesn't save,

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,880
what's the difference how I live?

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,520
What's the difference, therefore,

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,180
whether my Christian life is sloppy,

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,580
whether it doesn't measure up,

52
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,760
whether it's absolutely inferior,

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,320
whether it's the kind of a life

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,520
that is not becoming me as a Christian,

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,880
what's the difference?

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,060
After all, isn't it foolishness

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,300
to live on the beam

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,280
when we are not saved by our life?

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,420
Some of us may even draw this conclusion.

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,600
We may say,

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
why, the thing that we ought to do

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,080
is to go out and to sing to our heart's content

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,220
because the more we sin,

64
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,920
the more we show the world

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,880
how great is the forgiving grace of God.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
If we go out and kill

67
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,240
and live in adultery and murder,

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,980
why, the world would say,

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,200
my, how tremendously best

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,340
is the grace of God that forgives

71
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,760
and actually we would be glorifying grace.

72
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,960
That's the way some Christians sometimes feel

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,260
about their Christian life.

74
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,460
And that's why today

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,180
we want to talk about this thing

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,220
of carelessness,

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,020
of indifference,

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,760
of sloppy Christian living.

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,220
Doesn't it make any difference

80
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,100
even though we are saved

81
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,260
by the saving grace of God

82
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,900
and our lives do not save us?

83
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,560
The speaker this morning

84
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,620
from the Word of God

85
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,120
is the Apostle Paul,

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,980
the little Jew

87
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,960
from up in Tarsus in Cilicia,

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,340
the great war horse

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,360
of the Christian church.

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
And we find him writing

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
to his Christian congregation at Rome.

92
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,640
And yet then,

93
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,960
when he had spoken to them

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,060
about the very fact

95
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,840
that we are saved

96
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,340
by the forgiving grace of God,

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
and there was a danger

98
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,520
that because they would know

99
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,340
that they were saved

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,460
by the mercy of God

101
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,400
in Christ Jesus

102
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,620
and not by their lives,

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,860
that somehow or other

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,920
they would get the idea

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,940
that the Christian life

106
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,840
is not important

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,260
and that they would go out

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,560
and say,

109
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,240
now I can sin to my heart's content.

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,460
It doesn't make any difference.

111
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,200
And therefore,

112
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,720
I do not have to avoid

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
being off of the beam.

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,600
And so he wrote to them

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
as he speaks to you

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,640
and me this morning,

117
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,840
assuring us

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,940
that we are saved

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,520
by the forgiving grace of God

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,140
to be sure.

121
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,280
Assuring us

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,880
that you and I

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,560
are not saved by our lives

124
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,740
and but therefore

125
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,040
telling and calling

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
to us as Christians

127
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,620
to avoid being off of the beam,

128
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
to avoid carelessness

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,480
in a sloppy Christian life,

130
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,060
to avoid anything

131
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,680
that doesn't measure up

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,900
because this is what

133
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,280
he told the Christians at Rome,

134
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,060
he says,

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,260
do you not know

136
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,620
that as many of us

137
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,760
as were baptized

138
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,460
into Jesus Christ

139
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,500
were baptized

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,240
into his death?

141
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
Do you not realize

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,700
that because you were baptized

143
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,460
into Christ's death

144
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,620
that therefore

145
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,040
you must avoid

146
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,380
being off of the beam

147
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,440
in your Christian life?

148
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,220
You've got to get rid

149
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,120
of a sloppy Christian living.

150
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,780
You've got to get rid

151
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,020
of that which is inferior.

152
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,880
You dare not be off of the beam.

153
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,440
You've got to be on the beam

154
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,900
even though you are not

155
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,920
saved by your life

156
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,580
because when you were baptized,

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,780
do you not know

158
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,960
that you were baptized

159
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,260
into his death?

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
It's well this morning

161
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,900
as we are here in God's house

162
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,180
to take a look at our baptism

163
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,320
and to realize

164
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,060
just what it has meant to us

165
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,140
and what it means

166
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,900
to be baptized

167
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,300
into Christ's death.

168
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,600
If there is anything

169
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,160
in the world

170
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
that ought to cause you

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,720
and me to avoid

172
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,800
being off of the beam,

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,660
to avoid sloppy Christian living,

174
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,080
the kind of living

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
that just doesn't measure up,

176
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
it is not becoming

177
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,380
you and me,

178
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
it ought to be this.

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,940
We were baptized

180
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,480
into Jesus Christ

181
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
and thus into his death

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,380
and that in the first place

183
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,940
means this,

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,780
that when you and I

185
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,460
were baptized

186
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,040
and baptized into his death,

187
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,480
that means that we were

188
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,180
joined to Christ's death,

189
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,440
that death

190
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,820
which made it possible

191
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,100
for the forgiving

192
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,640
grace of God

193
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,420
to operate.

194
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,920
How many of us

195
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
realize this,

196
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,460
that if Christ

197
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,620
had not died,

198
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,180
the grace of God

199
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,980
could never

200
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,340
have forgiven sin?

201
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,820
Some people say,

202
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,520
well God is a forgiving God,

203
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,180
he's gracious

204
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,020
and he's merciful,

205
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,300
therefore God

206
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,020
can forgive sins easily,

207
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,020
but listen,

208
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
God himself

209
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
could not forgive sins

210
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
had it not been

211
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,920
for the death

212
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,300
of his son Jesus Christ.

213
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,620
The second person

214
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,180
of the Trinity,

215
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,980
God the Son,

216
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,640
had to come out

217
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,100
of the ivory palaces

218
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,220
into this world of sin,

219
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,180
become a human being

220
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,840
without sin

221
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,820
and he had to go

222
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
to Calvary's cross

223
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,260
and there he had to die.

224
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Why?

225
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Because God

226
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,600
is a God of grace

227
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,340
but he's also

228
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,400
a God of justice

229
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
and being a God

230
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,260
of justice

231
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,540
when the soul sins

232
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,580
and it's punishable

233
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,160
by death,

234
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,600
God must carry out

235
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,860
that verdict of justice

236
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
and therefore

237
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
for God

238
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
to be merciful,

239
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,980
for God

240
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,620
to forgive

241
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,000
on the basis of grace,

242
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
Christ had to die

243
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
and he had to meet

244
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,220
the justice of God

245
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,200
and you and I

246
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
don't understand Calvary

247
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,420
until we stand there

248
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,160
and say there was

249
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,800
God's Son

250
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
who willingly

251
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,580
met the justice

252
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,220
of God.

253
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,380
He on the cross

254
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,200
he bore the guilt

255
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,820
and the punishment

256
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,360
of the world.

257
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,720
He endured the equal

258
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,440
of an eternity

259
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,020
in hell

260
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,900
for the human race

261
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,940
and he met

262
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,420
the justice of God

263
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,800
so that by meeting

264
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
God's justice

265
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,980
therefore it was possible

266
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,720
for God

267
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,500
who is merciful

268
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,060
and gracious

269
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,120
to have a forgiving grace

270
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,140
and to forgive sins

271
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,940
and therefore

272
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,740
when you and I

273
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,360
were baptized

274
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,940
we received

275
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,080
we were given

276
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
this forgiving grace

277
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,580
of God.

278
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,700
How many of us

279
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,960
realize that the greatest

280
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,740
thing that has ever

281
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,700
happened to you and me

282
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,600
has been our baptism?

283
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,220
When in infancy

284
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,060
you and I

285
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,600
were brought

286
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,740
by means of water

287
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,880
and the word of God

288
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
in baptism

289
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,680
something tremendous

290
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
happened

291
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,940
and what happened

292
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,580
in baptism

293
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,640
we were united

294
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,400
and joined

295
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,740
to the death of Christ

296
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,140
and the merciful

297
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,640
forgiveness of God

298
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,620
became ours

299
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,020
and we were forgiven

300
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,840
our sins

301
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,060
delivered from hell

302
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,840
and damnation

303
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,620
and given eternal life

304
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,820
and bear in mind

305
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660
when on the day

306
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,460
of your baptism

307
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,860
in mind

308
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,220
that tremendous miracle

309
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,040
of God's grace

310
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,460
happened

311
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,640
that grace

312
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,340
was given

313
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,980
you and me

314
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,840
to save us

315
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
never to be exploited

316
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
what happens

317
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,760
when a Christian

318
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,960
who has been baptized

319
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,460
into Christ's death

320
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,480
doesn't care

321
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
how he lives

322
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,360
what happens

323
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
when he's off

324
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,820
of the beam

325
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,940
what happens

326
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,740
when his Christian

327
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,780
life is sloppy

328
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,880
it's everything

329
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,680
but what it ought

330
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,220
to be

331
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,540
when your life

332
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,080
and mine

333
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,820
is sloppy

334
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,560
even though we are

335
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,780
not saved by our life

336
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,020
that means that

337
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,760
we are looking

338
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
at God's grace

339
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
and we are making

340
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,480
it mean

341
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,100
that God

342
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,980
is stupid

343
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,040
listen

344
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,140
can you think

345
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,100
of a greater crime

346
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,700
than to look

347
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,140
at God's merciful grace

348
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,320
and to try

349
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
to interpret it

350
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,080
in such a way

351
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,640
that God

352
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,120
ends up being stupid

353
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,700
that's what we do

354
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,140
you may say

355
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,840
what do you mean

356
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,420
God's grace

357
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,960
was given

358
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
for one reason

359
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,460
to save

360
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,820
yet it's possible

361
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
for many a Christian

362
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,840
look at God's grace

363
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,400
and to say

364
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,980
God I've got an angle

365
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,300
God you're rather stupid

366
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,080
I know how to get

367
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
around you

368
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,140
your grace

369
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,880
is so great

370
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,780
to forgive me

371
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,460
therefore

372
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,180
since it's so vast

373
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,620
and I'm not saved

374
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,460
by my life

375
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,780
I can go out

376
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,260
and live

377
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,800
just as I please

378
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,180
and I'll go out

379
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,800
and sin

380
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,460
to the very

381
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,300
limits of my ability

382
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,620
and your grace

383
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,800
is always bigger

384
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,120
in other words

385
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,940
we say to God

386
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,380
God you're not so smart

387
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,320
as you think you are

388
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm a little more clever

389
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,140
than you are

390
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,340
I've got a way

391
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,100
around this thing

392
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,820
that I can live

393
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,520
as I please

394
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,340
I can be off

395
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,840
of the beam

396
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,380
and still be saved

397
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,820
because your grace

398
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,020
is big enough

399
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,880
to allow me

400
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,980
to do as I please

401
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,460
and listen

402
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,320
whenever you and I

403
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,980
accuse God

404
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,840
of being stupid

405
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,660
whenever you and I

406
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,700
say God

407
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,360
I can take advantage

408
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,760
of you

409
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,300
and I can exploit you

410
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,880
whenever you and I

411
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
play God

412
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
for a fool

413
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
watch out

414
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,300
listen friends

415
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,840
the forgiving grace

416
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,420
of God

417
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,000
was given

418
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
for one reason

419
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,980
that was to save

420
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,700
never that you and I

421
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,080
could say

422
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
God I'm clever

423
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,440
I can get around it

424
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,600
and I'll live

425
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,420
as I please

426
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,340
off of the beam

427
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,080
and your grace

428
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,760
is so big

429
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,180
that it will forgive me

430
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,200
you know it's like this

431
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,580
supposing a man

432
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,200
were dying

433
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,920
of a horrible

434
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,160
venereal disease

435
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,800
and realizing

436
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,820
that he was dying

437
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,460
of it because

438
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
of a profligate life

439
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,980
he found that

440
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,100
there was a medication

441
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
that would arrest it

442
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,560
and then he would

443
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,700
take that cure

444
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,660
that would arrest

445
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,880
this venereal disease

446
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,440
only to say

447
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,420
the reason for

448
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,700
the medical cure

449
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,720
is that I can go back

450
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,420
and live as I did

451
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,680
and when any Christian

452
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
accepts the grace

453
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,640
of God

454
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,820
only to interpret it

455
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,400
as God

456
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,340
you're a sap

457
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,180
and you're a fool

458
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,080
and you're stupid

459
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,780
that's my indication

460
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,960
that I can go back

461
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,840
and live again

462
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,900
that man's lost

463
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,060
the cure for

464
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,960
venereal disease

465
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,100
was never given

466
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
to allow man

467
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,040
to wallow in sin

468
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,800
that's what the word

469
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,580
of God means

470
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,700
when like dogs

471
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,300
we go back

472
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
and eat our vomit

473
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,740
whenever you and I

474
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,580
know we're not

475
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,020
saved by our life

476
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,200
but whenever

477
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,540
on the day of baptism

478
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,220
we were given

479
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,120
the forgiven grace

480
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,680
of God

481
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
it's time

482
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,900
that we as Christians

483
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,580
will realize

484
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,260
that it was given

485
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,000
for one reason

486
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
to say

487
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,300
never to allow

488
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,800
you and me

489
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,920
to exploit God

490
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,320
and say

491
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,380
God you're stupid

492
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm more clever

493
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,320
than you

494
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,000
I can go out

495
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,860
and live as I please

496
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,140
because your grace

497
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,460
is greater than my sin

498
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,120
God forbid

499
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
perish the thought

500
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
and that's why today

501
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
when again

502
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,960
we realize

503
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,740
that we're saved

504
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,860
by the forgiving grace

505
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,400
of God

506
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,260
and we're not saved

507
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,040
by our life

508
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,380
but when St. Paul

509
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,360
calls upon you

510
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,660
and me

511
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,040
to say

512
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
avoid sloppy

513
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Christian living

514
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
when you and I

515
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
live and our life

516
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,420
doesn't measure up

517
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
to what it ought to be

518
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,920
and we know it

519
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,400
and we don't care

520
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,180
when we're off

521
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,800
of the beam

522
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,300
and we say

523
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,260
what's the difference

524
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,460
I can live

525
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,100
as I please

526
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,800
I can sin

527
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,780
to my heart's content

528
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,400
today ought to be

529
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,780
the day

530
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,240
when we say

531
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,480
to ourselves

532
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
I was baptized

533
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,340
and when I was baptized

534
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,460
I was baptized

535
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,420
and I became

536
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,880
sharers of Christ's death

537
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,280
and I received

538
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
the grace of God

539
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,980
and therefore

540
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,300
we ought to say

541
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,060
to ourselves

542
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,040
I am going

543
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
to be on the beam

544
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
I shall avoid

545
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,300
anything in my

546
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,120
Christian life

547
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
that puts me

548
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,860
to the right

549
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,620
or to the left

550
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,220
of center

551
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,960
God wants

552
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
no sloppy

553
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
Christian living

554
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,120
when we can say that

555
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,600
and mean it

556
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,320
then and only then

557
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,860
will we begin

558
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,420
to appreciate

559
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,200
what it means

560
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
that we have been baptized

561
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,500
you know Paul

562
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,860
appreciated his baptism

563
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,360
immensely

564
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,980
did he not

565
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,060
he was on the way

566
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,800
to Damascus

567
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,660
you know up in Syria

568
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,560
when he met his Lord

569
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,480
and he was stricken

570
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,080
with blindness

571
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,980
and he went into

572
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,180
Damascus

573
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,980
and he stayed there

574
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,640
for three days

575
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,460
and he was blinded

576
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,060
at that time

577
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,720
and he was either

578
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,900
able to eat or to drink

579
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,060
and then the Lord God

580
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,840
went to a man

581
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
and said to him

582
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,180
his name was Ananias

583
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,660
he is not the other Ananias

584
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,340
you know it's too bad

585
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,580
they both have the same names

586
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,020
he's not the Ananias

587
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,600
and Sapphira

588
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,360
who were liars

589
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,020
but there was another Ananias

590
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,160
a Christian living up there

591
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,820
in Damascus

592
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,140
and God told Ananias

593
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,340
to go to a street

594
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,020
called Straight

595
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,920
to a home of a man

596
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,600
in the name of Judas

597
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,220
and there again

598
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,540
it was not Judas Iscariot

599
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
Judas Iscariot was dead

600
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,920
and he went to the home

601
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,880
of a man in the name of Judas

602
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
and he went there

603
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,260
and he said

604
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,480
you shall find this man

605
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,500
Saul of Tarsus

606
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
and Ananias went

607
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,440
you know

608
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
and again when he put

609
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,740
his hands on him

610
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,220
and prayed

611
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,660
Paul was able

612
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,360
to see again

613
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,120
and then we are told

614
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
that Paul was baptized

615
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,340
the grace of God

616
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,360
the grace of God

617
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,000
was granted

618
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
and sealed to him

619
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,340
the very death

620
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,360
of Jesus Christ

621
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,780
and because he was baptized

622
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,280
it meant a tremendous thing

623
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,340
how thankful

624
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,220
we ought to be

625
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,340
that in baptism

626
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,320
again

627
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,300
we became

628
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
children of God

629
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,040
and the mercy

630
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,020
and the grace of God

631
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,000
became ours

632
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,260
how thankful

633
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,500
that we have had parents

634
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,260
who in infancy

635
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,100
again

636
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,860
have brought us

637
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,400
as infants

638
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,560
to the kingdom of God

639
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,860
because even children

640
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,900
are born in sin

641
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,680
and they need

642
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,700
to be regenerated

643
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,160
and they need

644
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,140
the mercy of God

645
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,320
the very fact

646
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,400
that we have been baptized

647
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,100
it ought to be

648
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,140
the greatest occasion

649
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,180
of your life and mine

650
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,780
that is when God

651
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,600
did something

652
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,940
we were baptized

653
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,840
in connection

654
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,300
with Christ's death

655
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,240
the death

656
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,960
that brought life

657
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,640
and salvation

658
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,320
and enabled

659
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,420
even our God

660
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,360
to be a God

661
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,940
of mercy

662
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,620
oh we are saved

663
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,240
by grace

664
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,740
and you know

665
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,940
especially we Lutherans

666
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,840
we say if I'm saved

667
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,340
by grace

668
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,220
therefore it doesn't

669
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,640
make any difference

670
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,260
how I live

671
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,900
life isn't very important

672
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,460
it's foolish

673
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,600
to watch your life

674
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,580
and yet again

675
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,360
we're talking about

676
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,940
this thing of

677
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,200
careless Christian living

678
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,240
sloppiness

679
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
yes just being

680
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,560
run over at the heels

681
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,080
type of

682
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,420
who cares how we live

683
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,540
the idea that we can

684
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,060
go out and do

685
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,580
just about as we please

686
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,140
God forbid

687
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,020
says Paul

688
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,200
don't you realize

689
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,000
that when you were

690
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,580
baptized into Christ Jesus

691
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,720
you were baptized

692
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,780
into his death

693
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,100
and we say

694
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
well what does that mean

695
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,580
well it not only means

696
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,320
that we were baptized

697
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,420
into his death

698
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,340
that made it possible

699
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
for God to be gracious

700
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,680
but we were baptized

701
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,700
we were joined

702
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,740
to Christ's death

703
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,640
which occurred

704
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
once and for all

705
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,740
thank God

706
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,600
Christ died

707
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,980
once and for all

708
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,260
he didn't have to die

709
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,080
a number of times

710
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
when he who was the

711
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,220
God man went to Calvary

712
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,940
his great sacrifice

713
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,820
was sufficient

714
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,120
for all of our sins

715
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,560
and also for the sins

716
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,080
of the world

717
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,780
the word of God

718
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,480
assures us that

719
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,260
it was a timeless

720
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,900
sacrifice

721
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,620
it was a sacrifice

722
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,900
as the lamb

723
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
slain from the

724
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,820
foundations of the world

725
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,080
when he died

726
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,740
to sin

727
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,680
that was it

728
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,080
he paid the price

729
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,460
and he was done

730
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,340
and finished with sin

731
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,060
now Paul makes

732
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,680
a comparison

733
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,760
Paul said

734
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,120
now you are baptized

735
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,180
when you were baptized

736
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,940
in connection

737
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,660
with his death

738
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,040
you are sharers

739
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,700
of that death

740
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,800
that like as Christ

741
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,280
was finished with sin

742
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,560
so are you

743
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
finished with sin

744
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,220
you also have

745
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,900
died unto sin

746
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,340
when we have

747
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,700
died unto sin

748
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,120
we have died

749
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,940
in baptism

750
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,140
because Christ

751
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,120
came to live

752
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,000
in our hearts

753
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,340
and when he came

754
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,280
to live in our hearts

755
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,000
the day that you

756
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,860
and I were baptized

757
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,640
he came to give us

758
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,240
power

759
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,720
in order to resist

760
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
the temptations

761
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
and the enticements

762
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,800
of life

763
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,500
how can you

764
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,040
and I

765
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,060
who have Christ

766
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,080
living within us

767
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
who have died

768
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
therefore to sin

769
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
how in the world

770
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,720
can we as a Christian

771
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,440
never say

772
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
that sloppy Christian

773
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,500
living is alright

774
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,280
we can live a life

775
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,080
that leaves a lot

776
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,820
to be desired

777
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,640
it doesn't make

778
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,140
any difference

779
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,160
whether we measure up

780
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
it doesn't make

781
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,680
any difference

782
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,360
whether we're on

783
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,760
the beam

784
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,240
or whether we're

785
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,960
off of the beam

786
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,340
how in the world

787
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,700
can a child of God

788
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,500
that is baptized

789
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,840
ever say that

790
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,140
when in baptism

791
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,320
he has been connected

792
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,880
with the death

793
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,420
of Jesus

794
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,680
Paul says

795
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,640
we are dead to sin

796
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,420
like a dead man

797
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,360
take a dead man

798
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,020
who has died

799
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,880
from acute alcoholism

800
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,220
alright he's here

801
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,000
in the casket

802
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,660
he's died

803
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,560
because he is

804
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,740
drunk to excess

805
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,100
you can line

806
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,340
that man's casket

807
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,020
with all the

808
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
alcoholic beverages

809
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,620
you want

810
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,640
you can surround

811
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
that casket

812
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
with all of the

813
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
alcohol you want

814
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,700
that man's dead

815
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,420
and there is

816
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,900
no enticement

817
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,480
anymore

818
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,740
he's dead

819
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,440
to that temptation

820
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,900
or you can take

821
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,060
a man that has died

822
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,780
because of

823
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
profligate living

824
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,480
and you can surround

825
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,440
that casket

826
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,300
when he's dead

827
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,400
with all of the

828
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,660
Christine Keelers

829
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,440
and all of the

830
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,160
called girls

831
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,080
in the world

832
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,540
and they can stand

833
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,760
there and entice

834
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,560
and induce

835
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,820
but he's dead

836
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,080
therefore he is

837
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,680
immune

838
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,520
to temptation

839
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,920
and in the same way

840
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,660
when you and I

841
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,400
were baptized

842
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
and Christ moved

843
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,180
into your heart

844
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,600
and mind

845
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,260
by faith

846
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,300
he gave us power

847
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,760
so that as he died

848
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,740
once and for all

849
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,300
for sin

850
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,920
by turning to him

851
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,540
for power

852
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,240
you and I

853
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
have died

854
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,540
once and for all

855
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,820
to temptation

856
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,220
and to enticement

857
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,320
and therefore

858
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,660
when it's shoddy

859
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
Christian living

860
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,220
when it's sloppy

861
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,760
living

862
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,940
when you and I

863
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,080
are not on the beam

864
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
when your life

865
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,760
and mine

866
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
needs so much

867
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,380
to be desired

868
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,220
and we know it

869
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,180
and we don't care

870
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,820
what are we doing

871
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,620
we are saying

872
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,780
to Jesus Christ

873
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,600
who came to live

874
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:35,920
with us

875
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,740
when we were baptized

876
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,300
I don't want you

877
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,860
as savior

878
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,100
we are saying

879
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,400
to him

880
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,460
get out of my life

881
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,660
we are saying

882
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:42,960
to him

883
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,620
as far as

884
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,500
Calvary is concerned

885
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
he didn't have to die

886
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,800
for me

887
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,480
and may I say

888
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,360
with all the strength

889
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,320
of my own soul

890
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,080
that any man

891
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,780
that defies

892
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,660
Jesus Christ

893
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,380
and drives him

894
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,080
out of his life

895
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,720
is lost

896
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,540
he is lost

897
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,900
because of his life

898
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,080
not because

899
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,980
the forgiving

900
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,120
grace of God

901
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,620
failed

902
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,440
but because

903
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,500
by sloppy

904
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,320
Christian living

905
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,640
he drove

906
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,540
Jesus Christ

907
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,400
from his life

908
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,060
and that's why

909
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,600
you and I

910
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,000
today

911
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,480
when again

912
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,200
we talk about

913
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
salvation by grace

914
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
and that's true

915
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,400
and we say

916
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,160
we're not saved

917
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,900
by our life

918
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,760
and that's true

919
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
but nevertheless

920
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,920
it does not

921
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,540
follow from

922
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,780
those two truths

923
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,740
that it makes

924
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,220
no difference

925
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,940
how you and I

926
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,320
live

927
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
we dare not

928
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,280
say that we

929
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,840
can be off

930
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,280
of the beam

931
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,900
Paul

932
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,840
called with the

933
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,700
intensity of his

934
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,320
being to the

935
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,020
Roman Christians

936
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,480
you have got

937
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,440
to see to it

938
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,020
that you're not

939
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,820
off of the beam

940
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,240
away with

941
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,860
careless

942
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,880
Christian living

943
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
and if we

944
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,700
would determine

945
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
today as

946
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,900
baptized Christians

947
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,620
that we are

948
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,360
going to see

949
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,900
to it that

950
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,540
we are never

951
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,180
off of the

952
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,520
beam

953
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,080
that to the

954
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,680
strength that

955
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,240
we have in

956
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,060
Jesus Christ

957
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,360
we are going

958
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,920
to therefore

959
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
avoid careless

960
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,920
Christian living

961
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,860
then there would

962
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,220
be some

963
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,100
discipline in

964
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,700
our life

965
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,840
how many of

966
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,400
us when we

967
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,120
became a

968
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,780
Christian or

969
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,280
when we were

970
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,220
baptized or

971
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,020
embraced Christ

972
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,400
ever said to

973
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,940
ourselves

974
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,120
now it's

975
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,860
something where

976
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,440
I've got to

977
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,260
discipline my

978
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,660
life

979
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,560
you know we

980
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,180
sing the old

981
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,720
song

982
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,020
take my

983
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,960
life and

984
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,860
let it be

985
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,940
and that's

986
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,800
just about the

987
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,280
way some

988
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,120
Christians feel

989
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,520
about it

990
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,040
they stop

991
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,680
to take my

992
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,360
life Lord

993
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,440
and let it

994
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,340
be just as

995
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,740
it is

996
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,320
I want it

997
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
warm and I

998
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,200
want to live

999
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,040
just as I

1000
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,020
please and I'm

1001
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,820
going to fulfill

1002
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,720
the lusts of my

1003
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,960
heart and don't

1004
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
you get in my

1005
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,860
way take my

1006
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,740
life Lord and

1007
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,440
save me but

1008
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,700
let me be

1009
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,640
but the hymn

1010
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,720
says take my

1011
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,020
life and let

1012
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,700
it be consecrated

1013
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,540
Lord to the

1014
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,100
tremendous

1015
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,540
difference when

1016
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,320
the athlete gets

1017
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,880
ready he

1018
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,980
disciplines himself

1019
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,640
and he trains

1020
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,160
himself how

1021
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,700
many of us

1022
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,580
train ourselves

1023
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,420
to be on the

1024
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,640
being how

1025
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,980
many of us

1026
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,520
say it's of

1027
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,860
utmost importance

1028
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,440
that our lives

1029
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,300
shall not be

1030
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
sloppy Christian

1031
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,180
lives but will

1032
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,740
be on the

1033
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,360
being to have

1034
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,120
lives that are

1035
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
commensurate with

1036
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,800
our Christian

1037
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,180
faith to have

1038
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,300
lives that measure

1039
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,420
up to a certain

1040
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,360
degree with what

1041
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,280
that life ought to

1042
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,000
be that it

1043
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,720
because we are

1044
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,260
baptized when

1045
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
God says I

1046
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,880
shall have no

1047
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,940
other gods before

1048
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,440
me how many of

1049
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,040
us discipline

1050
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,900
ourselves and

1051
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,780
say God's got

1052
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,480
to come first

1053
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,840
when God says

1054
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,700
not to take his

1055
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,620
name in vain how

1056
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,200
many of us have

1057
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,560
controlled ourselves

1058
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,060
that blasphemy and

1059
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,920
cursing do not

1060
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,660
come from our

1061
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,560
hearts because it's

1062
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,440
wrong we're off

1063
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,900
the beam when

1064
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,840
God says remember

1065
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,740
the Sabbath day to

1066
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,640
keep it holy how

1067
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,680
many of us discipline

1068
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,480
ourselves to say

1069
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,560
that we're going to

1070
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,540
worship God and

1071
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,600
be in his house

1072
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
unless God makes

1073
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,060
it absolutely

1074
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,800
impossible how

1075
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,360
many of us have

1076
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,260
ever disciplined or

1077
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,160
is our prayer be

1078
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,220
take my life and

1079
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,420
let it be don't you

1080
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,300
bother me Lord don't

1081
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,700
get in my way I'm

1082
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,440
going to send to my

1083
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,140
heart's content

1084
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,740
honor thy father and

1085
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,140
thy mother how many

1086
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,220
of us are disciplined

1087
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,780
in life beyond the

1088
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,780
beam with honoring our

1089
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,700
parents and God

1090
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,740
says thou shalt not

1091
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,620
kill how many of us

1092
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,780
say hatred is wrong

1093
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,440
whether it's in your

1094
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,820
heart or mine and

1095
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,860
therefore hatred is

1096
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,740
something that dare

1097
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,140
not be found in the

1098
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,040
Christian life because

1099
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,740
you're off the beam

1100
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,100
that's sloppy Christian

1101
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,520
living that is

1102
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,820
dethroning Christ

1103
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,260
thou shalt not

1104
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,360
commit adultery how

1105
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,620
many of us looking

1106
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,820
into our own hearts

1107
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,960
have got to say away

1108
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,020
with sinful thoughts

1109
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,820
and desires I've in

1110
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,560
baptism died to sin

1111
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,120
thou shalt not steal

1112
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,460
honesty in business

1113
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,380
honesty with one

1114
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,060
another bearing false

1115
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,420
witness watching the

1116
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,620
tongue that we speak

1117
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,980
in love not coveting

1118
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,920
how many of us have

1119
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,320
disciplined ourselves

1120
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,360
or is it only this

1121
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,580
take my life and let

1122
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,000
it be that it's a

1123
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,980
great party and we

1124
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,940
say boy this is

1125
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,320
heaven too what a

1126
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,340
chump is God and oh

1127
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,760
how stupid God can

1128
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,940
you be to save us by

1129
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,500
grace that leaves us

1130
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,620
and not we can go out

1131
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,880
and live just as we

1132
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
please no you can't

1133
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
live just as you

1134
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,300
please you and I

1135
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,780
were baptized into his

1136
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,400
death and that also

1137
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,520
means this that when

1138
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,800
we were baptized into

1139
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,760
the death of Jesus

1140
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,580
Christ we were put

1141
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,040
into a relationship

1142
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,080
we were joined to his

1143
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,160
death which occurred

1144
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,720
once and that was

1145
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,780
followed by his

1146
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,240
resurrection Paul says

1147
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,940
Christ died once and

1148
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,060
then he rose again and

1149
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,580
we know that he did he

1150
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,540
rose from the dead

1151
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,520
showing that he had

1152
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,800
gained the salvation

1153
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,960
that he had again

1154
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,460
atoned for on Calvary

1155
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,960
and now Paul makes an

1156
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,360
analogy he says Christ

1157
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
died to sin then he

1158
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,520
arose to a new life

1159
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,020
then again that human

1160
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,080
nature of his shared

1161
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,060
in all the glory of

1162
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,920
the divine nature

1163
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,700
true God and true man

1164
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,520
and he appeared and

1165
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
he disappeared to the

1166
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,420
disciples and to his

1167
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,840
followers there was the

1168
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,620
glory that was his

1169
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,480
and newness of life

1170
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
Paul says in the same

1171
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,360
way when you were

1172
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,320
baptized into his

1173
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,540
death you died to sin

1174
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,600
and then he says you

1175
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,800
arose to a new life

1176
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,840
why because the Holy

1177
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,940
Spirit came to dwell

1178
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,640
into our hearts

1179
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,280
baptism means that

1180
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,220
something happened to

1181
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,900
you and me something

1182
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,200
miraculous what

1183
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,560
happened why we were

1184
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,720
born of water and the

1185
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,980
spirit we were born

1186
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,380
again the Holy Ghost

1187
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,320
on the day of your

1188
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,820
baptism and mine he

1189
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,880
came into our hearts

1190
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,840
for the first time or

1191
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,980
sealed himself when we

1192
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,440
were baptized and when

1193
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,540
the Holy Spirit came

1194
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,480
into your hearts and

1195
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
life and mine we were

1196
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,820
born a second time

1197
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,480
there was a living faith

1198
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,860
in Jesus Christ and

1199
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,760
when the Holy Spirit

1200
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,260
came to dwell in us he

1201
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,800
came so that our lives

1202
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,820
when we would strive

1203
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
would be pleasing to

1204
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,200
God isn't it a

1205
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,280
marvelous thing to know

1206
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,620
that the Spirit of God

1207
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,520
dwells in you and me

1208
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
since the day of our

1209
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
baptism when we were

1210
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,460
baptized as infants

1211
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,120
that it's sealed to us

1212
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,380
as we were baptized as

1213
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,600
adults and that Holy

1214
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
Spirit takes the efforts

1215
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,780
of your life and mine

1216
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,740
and he adds the

1217
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,680
righteousness of Jesus

1218
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Christ that our life

1219
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,880
becomes pleasing to God

1220
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
and listen in the moment

1221
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,340
when we say to ourselves

1222
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,000
it doesn't make any

1223
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
difference how I live

1224
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
I can live a sloppy

1225
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,880
Christian life I don't

1226
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,980
have to measure up I

1227
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,120
can just be a lazy

1228
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,940
fair individual and let

1229
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,180
it go and come and let

1230
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,880
my life be just as it is

1231
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,160
but in the moment when

1232
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,060
that becomes our

1233
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,920
attitude what are we

1234
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,600
doing we're grieving

1235
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,060
the Holy Spirit the

1236
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,440
Holy Spirit crying and

1237
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,520
striving with you and

1238
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,040
me struggling to get

1239
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,140
us again to live as

1240
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,080
God would have us live

1241
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,660
and we say no the

1242
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,940
tremendous danger is

1243
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,720
this that we hardened

1244
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,820
our hearts we hardened

1245
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,980
our consciences to the

1246
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,180
point where we can

1247
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,200
harden our hearts that

1248
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,080
the Holy Spirit will

1249
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,780
leave your life and

1250
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,520
mine and never come

1251
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,860
back and we'll never

1252
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,020
want him back and we

1253
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,740
committed the sin

1254
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,760
against the Holy Ghost

1255
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,020
the unpardonable sin

1256
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,200
which is nothing but

1257
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,840
rebellion and you

1258
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,280
and I can lose life

1259
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,380
and salvation in the

1260
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,200
name of Jesus by

1261
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
living lives that are

1262
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
careless and sloppy

1263
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,180
and off the beam and

1264
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,320
sinning against the

1265
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,560
Holy Ghost oh we are

1266
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
saved by grace yes we

1267
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,800
Lutherans we shout it to

1268
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,720
the heavens and that's

1269
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
the very joy of our

1270
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,140
church but let me tell

1271
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,080
you Lutheran Christians

1272
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,020
it's also a danger don't

1273
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,940
you ever draw the

1274
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,080
conclusion that God is

1275
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,460
stupid because he saved

1276
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,980
us by grace and that

1277
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,040
therefore it doesn't make

1278
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,000
any difference how we

1279
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,120
live and we can be off

1280
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,100
of the beam and live a

1281
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,940
sloppy life and grace is

1282
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,580
sufficient whenever there

1283
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,060
is sloppiness in your life

1284
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,300
and mine and we know it

1285
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
we're grieving the Holy

1286
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,540
Spirit and that's a

1287
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,240
dangerous dangerous thing

1288
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,340
today we ought to say to

1289
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,980
us thank God we are saved

1290
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,140
by his forgiving grace

1291
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,200
it's the only way he could

1292
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,840
save us but all if we

1293
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,580
just live as baptized

1294
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,120
Christians ought to live

1295
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,980
who have been baptized into

1296
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,200
Christ's death who are new

1297
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
people in him who are born

1298
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,200
again of the Holy Spirit

1299
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,960
what it would mean if we

1300
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,860
would just live as baptized

1301
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,240
Christians saying I'm going

1302
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,220
to get on the beam I've got

1303
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,100
to be right there right in

1304
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,520
center who knows what's going

1305
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,620
to happen oh it's wonderful

1306
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,680
to be on the beam and again

1307
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,900
no sloppy living you know

1308
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,340
Paul finally was brought back

1309
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,200
to Rome after he had been

1310
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,820
imprisoned for two years and

1311
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,920
he stood before his

1312
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,600
executioner and it was a

1313
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,160
matter of life and death

1314
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,360
and the big thing was Paul

1315
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,340
if you confess Jesus Christ

1316
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,720
as Lord your head's going

1317
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,200
to be cut off he didn't have

1318
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,540
to have his head cut off

1319
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,280
somebody said what would

1320
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,100
Paul what would he have had

1321
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,620
to have done to in order to

1322
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
have saved himself from

1323
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,220
execution why it was a

1324
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,600
simple thing if Paul when he

1325
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,220
stood in Rome and I stood at

1326
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,700
the place where tradition says

1327
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
he was beheaded if when Paul

1328
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,000
stood there and they asked

1329
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,180
him do you embrace Jesus

1330
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
Christ if he had been

1331
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,600
willing to take a little

1332
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,660
salt throw it over his

1333
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,420
shoulder pronounce the name

1334
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,560
of the emperor if he'd have

1335
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,420
said oh Nero and would have

1336
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,680
called upon one of the

1337
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,320
Roman gods said oh Jupiter

1338
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,940
that man could have walked

1339
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,880
out of there scot-free with

1340
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,680
his life we might say to

1341
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,840
ourselves well now wait a

1342
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,600
minute it wouldn't have made

1343
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
much difference would why

1344
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,420
didn't he take a little salt

1345
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:42,960
and throw it over his

1346
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,280
shoulder why didn't he say oh

1347
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,240
Nero why didn't he say oh

1348
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,040
Jupiter and he could have

1349
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,480
walked out oh he could have

1350
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,660
been a great help to the

1351
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,900
church why because Paul had

1352
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,280
been baptized into the death

1353
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,780
of Jesus and he knew that the

1354
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,820
saving grace of God was meant

1355
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,140
to save him never to use it and

1356
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,580
to look at God to use it as a

1357
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,480
way of escape and to interpret

1358
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,600
it as being something from a

1359
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,940
stupid God and because Paul's

1360
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,140
life as he lived it it wasn't a

1361
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,300
soggy looking thing it was

1362
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,820
something again it was not

1363
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,940
sloppy and because he lived in

1364
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,520
Christ he stood there and he

1365
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,720
said no there'll be no salt

1366
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,600
thrown over my shoulder I'll not

1367
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,860
call on Nero I'll not call on

1368
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,420
Jupiter I put my faith and my

1369
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,460
trust in Jesus Christ and again

1370
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,740
the sword cut that head from that

1371
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,840
body and he gave his life because

1372
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,380
he knew the joy of living a life

1373
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,240
and being on the beam and when we

1374
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,380
have lived our lives on the beam with

1375
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,820
the power of Jesus Christ because we

1376
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,860
have been baptized into his death

1377
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,360
think of the joy that awaits us

1378
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,280
yesterday we talked about the eclipse

1379
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,660
of the Sun didn't we were told not to

1380
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,560
look at it for a length of time lest

1381
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,240
indeed the brightness of the light of the

1382
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,460
rays would burn the eyes imagine what it

1383
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,700
will be when we have been on the ball

1384
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,640
showing that our faith in Jesus

1385
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,720
Christ and in his grace is a living

1386
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,520
thing when we shall see the great

1387
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,020
beam Jesus Christ and our eyes shall

1388
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,600
behold him and we shall not be blinded

1389
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,920
but we shall see him who is the

1390
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,860
brightest beam because he is God

1391
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,600
himself oh to do away with sloppiness

1392
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,720
in Christian living to do away with the

1393
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
idea that it doesn't make any

1394
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,180
difference to do away with the idea

1395
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,080
that it doesn't matter whether we're on

1396
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,960
the beam or off the beam oh to God that

1397
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,440
we could walk the glory road and we

1398
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,040
could have the assurance that comes when

1399
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,840
we can say to ourselves I know that

1400
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,340
when I was baptized thank God I was

1401
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,880
baptized into Christ's death and then a

1402
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,700
life well that gives evidence that we

1403
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,000
are still in grace and we can sing on the

1404
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,360
glory road blessed assurance Jesus is

1405
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,240
