1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
It be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,500
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in the letter of Paul to the Romans,

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,180
our regular epistolary lesson for this Sunday, reading there in the 8th chapter, especially the 14th verse.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:29,600
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,820
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,680
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,180
In Christ Jesus, the Lord of our life, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

8
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,420
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

9
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,900
Today, as we know, is the 8th Sunday after Trinity.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,760
That is the 8th Sunday since we have celebrated the festival of the Holy Trinity.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,780
And it is our custom on the Sundays after Trinity to deal with some of the practical matters of the Christian life.

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,460
And today we have this question to be asked, and it's this.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,780
Who are the sons of God?

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,480
Who are really God's children?

15
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,560
Who are really God's sons or God's daughters?

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,840
And I am sure that if without thinking you and I would answer, we would probably say hastily,

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,520
why, all of us are God's children.

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,640
All of us are sons of God.

19
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,600
All of us are daughters of God, whatever the case may be.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,700
And we would say, why, we are children of God because we are human beings.

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,340
All human beings are children of God.

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,480
You know, it's rather strange when we turn to the word of God, however, with that question,

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,620
and we ask on the basis of the scriptures,

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,120
just who are the sons and the daughters and the children of God?

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,380
We do not get that answer, that everyone, because he is a human being, is a son of God.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,060
We find the apostle Paul writing by authority of God in the scriptures

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,680
as he writes to the Christian congregation at Rome, talking about this very matter.

28
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,480
And this is what the word of God says,

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,920
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,460
God's word says, therefore, that not all men, because they are human beings, are children of God,

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:47,840
but only such as are led by the Holy Spirit, only those who have the Holy Spirit,

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,240
are really God's sons or God's children.

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,220
That's a bitter pill to swallow, isn't it?

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,860
Some of us may resent that strenuously.

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,300
To say, do you mean to say that only the person who is guided by the Holy Spirit,

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,880
that only a person that has the Holy Spirit is a child of God?

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,680
We may say to ourselves, that can't be right.

38
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,000
There's no connection between the Holy Spirit and between a person being a son of God.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,660
We may say, regardless of what anybody says,

40
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,540
I still believe that if I'm a human being, I'm a child of God.

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,500
And it doesn't make any difference whether I am led by the Holy Spirit,

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,400
whether I have him or whether I do not have him.

43
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,640
Quite a dispute, and it's quite bitter, isn't it?

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,560
But the fact still remains that when we turn to the authority of the Scriptures,

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,300
that the word of God tells us,

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,640
when we ask who are really God's sons and God's children,

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,400
the word of God says,

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:13,980
It is well this morning that we look at that statement from the word of God

49
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,680
to see whether it has any element of truth.

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,000
We may say there's no connection between the Holy Spirit and a man being a child of God,

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,740
but there is.

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,580
The Holy Spirit has a definite connection

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,400
because the Holy Spirit is the must in your life and mine

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
if we are children of God.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,720
He is the essential one

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,760
if you and I are sons and daughters of God.

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,600
Without the Holy Spirit, we are not sons of God.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,620
With him we are.

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,380
No human being, merely because he is a human being, is a child of God.

60
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,560
You've got to have the Holy Spirit and you've got to be led by him.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,940
Why?

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,780
Why is he the absolute must?

63
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,240
Why is he the absolute essential?

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,420
Why is he the absolute necessity

65
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,640
in order that we can call ourselves children of God?

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,360
Because in the first place, let's know this,

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
the Holy Spirit is the one who makes us sons of God.

68
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,200
We are not sons of God or children of God until the Holy Spirit makes us such.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,060
We are not children of God because we are merely human beings.

70
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,180
You may say to me,

71
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, preacher, what are we then if we aren't children of God?

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,980
We are creatures of God, but we are not sons and daughters, children of God.

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
But you may say to me this morning,

74
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,140
Well, that's just a matter of semantics.

75
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,660
You're just arguing words.

76
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,240
What's the difference whether I'm a creature of God or whether I'm a child of God?

77
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,460
It doesn't make any difference, doesn't it?

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
When you turn to the Word of God again,

79
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,920
if you and I are mere creatures of God,

80
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,880
because we have been created and given life,

81
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,060
we are most miserable of all men

82
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,080
because the Word of God says we were born in trespasses and sin.

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,240
And the Word of God says we are all children of wrath.

84
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,420
We are therefore, if we are mere creations of God, merely creatures,

85
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,980
then look at our natural status.

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,780
We come into this world without any knowledge of God,

87
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,820
and that's why a man who is worldly,

88
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,660
who doesn't know anything about God,

89
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,940
doesn't even know whom I'm talking about when I talk about the Holy Spirit.

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,820
You and I come into this world not knowing that there is one God

91
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,840
and yet three persons,

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,520
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

93
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,760
But we come into this world not knowing that the Holy Spirit is the one

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
who makes us children of God.

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,940
We come into this world being dead in sin,

96
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,000
under the contamination and the taint of guilt and the taint of punishment.

97
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,120
The very fact that you and I can die is an evidence

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,700
that we come into this world as sinners.

99
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,040
And therefore, if we are only creatures of God,

100
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,800
there is a tremendous difference

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,820
because as creatures of God we are lost.

102
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,320
We stand condemned in the sight of a just God.

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,400
And therefore, in order to be children of God,

104
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,340
we must have the Holy Spirit who is the one who comes to us

105
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,740
and who makes us sons of God.

106
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,100
And we may say, how does he do it?

107
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,420
In infancy he does it in baptism.

108
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,800
By means of baptism, being born of water in the Holy Spirit,

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,280
he makes us children of God.

110
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,620
He implants a living faith in Jesus Christ into our hearts.

111
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,060
And he comes to us as an adult when we can hear the Word of God.

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,620
And first of all, the Holy Spirit through the Word of God

113
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,520
brings us to a conviction of sin.

114
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,560
When you and I stand before God and admit that we are a sinner,

115
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,760
admit that we have broken God's law

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,780
and we deserve eternal death and damnation,

117
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,160
we are under conviction.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,360
And the Holy Spirit is the one who has brought us to that sorrow for sin.

119
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,720
And then the Holy Spirit through the Word of God

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
brings us to a living trust in Jesus Christ.

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,200
He causes you and me to stand in front of Calvary

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,940
and shows us the Christ who died for our sins,

123
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,180
the Christ that bore hell and damnation for you and me.

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,020
And when we are brought to put our trust in him and his righteousness,

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,540
then you and I and only then do we become children of God.

126
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,420
Paul uses a beautiful word.

127
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,100
He says we become in the spirit of adoption.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,980
God adopts us as his children.

129
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,680
You see, God has only one son,

130
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,860
the only begotten son, Jesus Christ.

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,840
And therefore, when we become children of God,

132
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
we become his children only in the one way

133
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,680
in which it's possible, by adoption.

134
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,100
And that's a beautiful word

135
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,660
because that word has the connotation of love,

136
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,000
that God desires to make you and me his children.

137
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,420
And therefore, the universal marks of a child of God

138
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,580
is this, first of all, a conviction of sin

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,260
and a real trust in Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior.

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,700
Well, that means we have been born again.

141
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,480
That means we have been converted,

142
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,260
whatever word you like.

143
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,360
But it is the Holy Spirit who brings you and me

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
into sonship with God.

145
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,220
Just being a human being means we are only God's creatures.

146
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,320
And when the Holy Spirit makes us children of God,

147
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,800
then we are granted from him the forgiveness of our sins

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,920
and we are delivered from the eternal punishment of sin.

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,680
What must it mean to be a son of God,

150
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,060
to be born again by means of the Holy Spirit,

151
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,580
to come to a living faith in Christ

152
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,060
and to know that sin is forgiven,

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,020
to be able to look at your life

154
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,000
and I to look at mine

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,540
and see everything that has been done

156
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,240
contrary to the divine will,

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,060
and then to know that by the blood of Jesus Christ,

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
which is the greatest solvent in all the world,

159
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,260
that the Holy Spirit by means of his blood

160
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,960
washes out of the book of life

161
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,980
everything that you and I have done

162
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,680
contrary to the will of God,

163
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,480
that your life and mine looks at God again

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,240
into all of its holiness and righteousness

165
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,580
because the blood of Jesus Christ,

166
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,980
God's Son, cleanseth us from all sin.

167
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,540
Well, that's what it means to be a son of God,

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,780
to be born again by the Holy Spirit,

169
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
to be delivered from eternal death

170
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,840
and eternal damnation.

171
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,820
That's the status of sonship.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,280
Who are children of God,

173
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,900
not you and not I merely because we're human beings,

174
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,180
know only those who are led by the Spirit,

175
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,700
who have the Holy Spirit,

176
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,300
none others, only God's children

177
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,000
by means of the Holy Spirit who is a necessity.

178
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,980
And when we begin to realize

179
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,560
that there is a tremendous difference

180
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,700
between children of God and those who are not,

181
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,820
well, then common honesty would lead you and me to say

182
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,580
that I want to be led by the Spirit,

183
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,200
that I might be a child of God.

184
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,340
And if that is your desire and mine,

185
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,820
then we ought to look within ourselves

186
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,000
and to ask ourselves,

187
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
do we have the Holy Spirit?

188
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,980
Are we being led by him?

189
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,960
How do you know whether you are led by the Spirit?

190
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,380
Have we come to repentance in Jesus Christ?

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Have we come to faith in him?

192
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,540
Jesus says,

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,700
By their fruits ye shall know them.

194
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,540
The only way to test the genuineness of your faith and mine

195
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,500
is by our life.

196
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,880
Jesus says,

197
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,680
Look at the tree.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,500
What kind of fruit are on the tree?

199
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,200
If there are nothing but corrupt fruits on your tree and mine,

200
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,320
then we are not children of God

201
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,780
because a good tree brings forth good fruit.

202
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,440
Not that you and I don't sin.

203
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,860
Every day we sin and do things that are wrong,

204
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,140
that we are not conscious of.

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,760
Every day we do things that we do not want to do,

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,220
but in your life and mine there ought not to be this,

207
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,920
that we deliberately do that which we know is wrong.

208
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,600
Are we of debtors to the flesh,

209
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,280
Paul says,

210
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,520
to live after the flesh

211
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,380
when we have become God's children?

212
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,040
We ought to look at the fruit of our life

213
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,500
and to see,

214
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,240
Does our life add up?

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,800
Is it the kind of life that ought to be a life

216
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,320
of one who is a child of God,

217
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,920
who is led by God's Spirit?

218
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,080
And when there is that evidence in your life and mine

219
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,020
that we are led by the Spirit

220
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,860
and that we are children of God,

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,760
that we have been made such by the Spirit,

222
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,020
then there is gone the fear of death

223
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,960
and the fear of an eternal punishment.

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,700
Man spoils himself in life, doesn't he,

225
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
by saying to himself,

226
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh, I am a creature of God.

227
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
I am a human being.

228
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Therefore, I am a child of God.

229
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,760
And yet, why the fear of death?

230
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,320
You know, we talk about funerals today

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,100
and we say they're getting smaller and smaller.

232
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,820
We always give us the only reason

233
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,800
because everybody works,

234
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,580
but that isn't the whole story, is it?

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,140
One reason why funerals are small is why?

236
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
Because we don't like to go to funerals.

237
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,400
Because when we go to funerals,

238
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,660
we are reminded of death.

239
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,900
And we do not like to be reminded of death

240
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
because some of us are afraid to die.

241
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,040
And we do not like to think of death

242
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,060
and to think of the judgment.

243
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,700
There might be a judgment.

244
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,300
And that's why some people are very prone

245
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,820
to want their bodies cremated,

246
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,040
hoping that if they should have their bodies

247
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,800
burned and ground into dust,

248
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,280
that even God Almighty will find the resurrection

249
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,720
of that body an impossibility.

250
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,000
But let us not deceive ourselves.

251
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,560
The mills of God grind slowly,

252
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,620
but they grind exceedingly fine,

253
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,560
and there will be a resurrection unto judgment.

254
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,180
And therefore, again,

255
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,720
we may look at our lives knowing this,

256
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,920
that not all of us are children of God,

257
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,020
only those of us who are led by the Spirit,

258
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,060
who have the Holy Spirit.

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,800
And oh, again, that burns us up, doesn't it?

260
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
And we resent that very thing.

261
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,160
But the Word of God says we are not God's children

262
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,360
simply because we're human beings.

263
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,000
The Word of God says,

264
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,420
for as many of us as are led by the Spirit of God

265
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,060
are the sons of God.

266
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,940
Having the Spirit makes the difference.

267
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,340
Why?

268
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,200
He is the absolute must in your life and mine

269
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
if we are children of God,

270
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,920
because the Holy Spirit also in the second place

271
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,100
is not only the one that makes us sons of God,

272
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,540
but He is the one who enables us to claim God as our Father.

273
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,880
Isn't it funny?

274
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,540
In terminology there, everybody calls God His Father.

275
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,440
We talk about the fatherhood of God,

276
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,100
and that's the lie of the age.

277
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,940
There isn't such a thing as the fatherhood of God.

278
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,800
God is no more the Father of all men

279
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
than you as the Father,

280
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,380
the Father of all children.

281
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,480
You are the Father only of your children,

282
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
even as I.

283
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,160
We are only Father to our own.

284
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,700
And then again, you may say,

285
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,700
well, what are you then if God isn't your Father?

286
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,840
God is the God of everybody,

287
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,740
but He is not the Father of everybody.

288
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,660
You say, that's semantics again.

289
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,080
You're arguing words.

290
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,880
What's the difference if God is my God

291
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,400
or whether God is my Father?

292
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,000
You may say,

293
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,420
doesn't a rose smell just as sweet,

294
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,460
even if you call it by another name?

295
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,040
Does it?

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is there any difference between God being your Father and mine

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,880
and God simply being our God?

298
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,280
There's a tremendous difference.

299
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,200
Because if I am not God's child

300
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,920
and He is not my Father,

301
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,540
then when I turn and pray to Him,

302
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,020
my prayers are totally unacceptable to Him.

303
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,140
How many men pray to some supreme being,

304
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,480
call God Father when Jesus Christ

305
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,660
doesn't live within their hearts?

306
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,160
I even had a minister tell me one day,

307
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,420
he says, when I'm in a group

308
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,780
where Christ isn't accepted

309
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,160
and I pray, I leave His name out.

310
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,980
Can you imagine anything any more blasphemous

311
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,100
than to leave out the name of Jesus Christ

312
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,960
in a prayer and deliberately do so

313
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,820
in order to deceive men

314
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,660
that God could possibly be a man's Father

315
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,940
except through Christ?

316
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Jesus put it this way,

317
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,100
He says,

318
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,340
no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

319
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,260
When we pray in the name of Jesus,

320
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,880
it isn't just a form.

321
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,040
When we say we ask it because of Jesus

322
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,200
or through His name or in His name,

323
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,900
listen, it isn't necessary that we say it,

324
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,620
but it's always implied

325
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,700
for the simple reason that

326
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,860
no prayer has the right to be prayed

327
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,600
except it's prayed in the Spirit of Jesus Christ

328
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,320
because God is the Father only

329
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
of those who by means of the Holy Spirit

330
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,420
have been brought to faith in Jesus Christ.

331
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,740
How many prayers do you pray in groups

332
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,760
where Christ isn't mentioned and met?

333
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,920
A prayer without Jesus Christ

334
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,900
where He is deliberately left out,

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
don't forget, is blasphemy.

336
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,320
The prayer is not heard,

337
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,740
it is not acceptable,

338
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,080
it isn't answered.

339
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,100
That is strong language, I know.

340
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,600
But that's the Word of God.

341
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,460
But oh, when the Holy Spirit

342
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,400
has brought you and me

343
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
into sonship with Christ,

344
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,700
then, Paul says,

345
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,700
we receive the spirit of adoption

346
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,180
whereby we can cry,

347
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,260
Abba, Father.

348
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,080
Do we realize what it means

349
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,980
to be able to call God

350
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,900
who has created us our Father?

351
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,760
I think of the time in the Civil War.

352
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,480
You recall the soldier

353
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,820
that was caught to sleep

354
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,940
on sentry duty

355
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,660
and was sentenced to be shot?

356
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,260
His father, when he heard about it,

357
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,220
came to Washington

358
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,180
to see Abraham Lincoln, the President.

359
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,340
Naturally having no credentials,

360
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,840
he couldn't get in the White House.

361
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,240
There he was seated on the curb

362
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,540
outside of the White House

363
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,640
crying because the life of his boy

364
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,580
was at stake.

365
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,820
There was a little boy that morning

366
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,180
playing on the sidewalk

367
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,880
outside of the White House

368
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
who walked up to the gentleman

369
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
and saw him crying and said,

370
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,720
what are you crying about?

371
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,360
The man told him,

372
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,860
I want to see the president,

373
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,080
but they won't let me in.

374
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,720
The little boy offered his hand

375
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,780
to the man and said,

376
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,400
come, we'll go see the president.

377
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,540
The man looked at the boy,

378
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,720
but he took his hand

379
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,360
and the guards left them

380
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,660
go down the sidewalk

381
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,080
and they opened the door

382
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,880
to the White House

383
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
and Abraham Lincoln,

384
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,460
the President of the United States,

385
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,060
was in session with his cabinet.

386
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,500
But the door opened

387
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,080
and the little boy walked up

388
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,340
to Abraham Lincoln

389
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,220
with the man

390
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,840
and he says,

391
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,360
Father,

392
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,260
this man wants to talk to you.

393
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,620
It happened to be Todd Lincoln.

394
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,540
Abraham Lincoln was President

395
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,820
of the United States,

396
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,740
but he was Todd Lincoln's father.

397
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,660
And Todd Lincoln,

398
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,500
with all boldness and confidence,

399
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,500
knew that his father

400
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,800
was never too busy to hear him.

401
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,880
And the man pled

402
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,020
for his boy's life

403
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,220
and his boy was saved.

404
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,640
That's the prerogative

405
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,600
and the honor

406
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,800
that comes to us

407
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,660
when by means

408
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,640
of the Holy Spirit,

409
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,920
God becomes our father.

410
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,600
And that means

411
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,280
that you and I

412
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,460
have a glorious privilege

413
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,440
of going to him

414
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,060
with a childlike confidence

415
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,760
any time.

416
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,760
God is never too busy

417
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
and God promises

418
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,480
to hear us

419
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,100
and to answer

420
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,360
and always in the best

421
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,200
possible way.

422
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,260
You may say to me,

423
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,560
what do you mean by best?

424
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,820
Why by best

425
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,580
from the standpoint

426
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,840
of the eternal destiny

427
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,020
of your soul and mine,

428
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,420
God answers the prayers

429
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,100
of his children

430
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,520
only in one way

431
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
and it's always the best way.

432
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,300
Sometimes he says no.

433
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,760
Sometimes God says yes,

434
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,820
but always there is strength

435
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,200
to bear the things

436
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
and always from the point

437
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,180
of view of eternity

438
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,740
that God says,

439
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,960
this thing that I give you,

440
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,640
my child,

441
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,340
is best.

442
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,900
There is a tremendous difference

443
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,480
and we ask,

444
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,860
who are children of God?

445
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,500
Oh, we can argue

446
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,540
all we want to

447
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,120
that everybody,

448
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,400
because he's a human being,

449
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,320
is a child of God.

450
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,120
He isn't.

451
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,700
You are not a child of God.

452
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,400
Neither am I

453
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,560
because I'm a human being.

454
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm anything

455
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,100
but a child of God.

456
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,760
For as many years

457
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,260
are led by the Spirit of God,

458
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,340
they are the sons of God.

459
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,480
And therefore,

460
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,660
when we see the status

461
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,800
of sonship,

462
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,540
that God becomes our Father,

463
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,140
well then it ought to be

464
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,040
the very essential

465
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
in your life and mind

466
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,960
that we ask ourselves,

467
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,200
am I a child of God?

468
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,580
Or am I just one

469
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,160
of his creatures?

470
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
Is God my Father?

471
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,760
Is he merely my creator?

472
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,800
We only need to look

473
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,340
at ourselves

474
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,240
and to ask ourselves,

475
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,080
how about prayer?

476
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,700
How about prayer in your life?

477
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
When did we pray last?

478
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
When did we turn to God

479
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,080
as our Father

480
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
with the confidence

481
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,540
that because he's our Father,

482
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,960
he is willing to listen?

483
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,200
How many of us

484
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,000
are going through life

485
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,820
worried stiff about tomorrow,

486
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,160
afraid to move

487
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,760
in the future?

488
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,120
And we look out

489
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,840
and we can say

490
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,460
as Burns said,

491
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,280
O ye banks

492
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,920
and braes of bonny dune,

493
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,740
how can ye bloom so fair?

494
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,240
How can ye chant,

495
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,060
ye little birds

496
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,900
and eyes so full of care?

497
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,880
How many of us

498
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,940
are so full of care

499
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,740
that life is almost meaningless

500
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,340
and we wonder

501
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
whether it's worthwhile

502
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,000
simply because

503
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
we've got a Father in Heaven

504
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,240
who promises

505
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,300
to hear and to answer

506
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,040
and we don't even pray.

507
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,520
If you and I

508
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,020
are guided

509
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,620
by the Spirit of God,

510
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,580
if we are sons of God,

511
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,260
we talk to our Father

512
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,080
because our Father

513
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,920
loves us

514
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,260
and our Father

515
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,360
promises courage

516
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,840
for the day.

517
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,220
Jesus prayed,

518
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,200
oh, when he was in Gethsemane,

519
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,220
look what a man of prayer

520
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,900
he was,

521
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,060
as a human being,

522
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,120
let alone God.

523
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,040
And I stood in Gethsemane

524
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,900
again thinking of

525
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,460
how he prayed

526
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,000
so fervently,

527
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,240
free to,

528
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,300
oh, my Father,

529
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,620
calling upon God

530
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,240
as Father.

531
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Oh, my Father,

532
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
if it be possible,

533
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,520
let this cup pass through.

534
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:50,820
Remember,

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
he spent all night

536
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,100
in prayer

537
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,860
before he chose

538
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,400
the twelve,

539
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,360
communing with God

540
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,380
as his Father

541
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,720
before he picked

542
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,260
the twelve

543
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,060
when he named

544
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,960
James the Greater

545
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
and James the Less

546
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,980
and John and Jude

547
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,480
and Judas

548
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,460
and Peter and Philip

549
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,500
and Matthew

550
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,060
and Andrew

551
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,920
and Bartholomew

552
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,500
and Simon

553
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,360
and Thomas.

554
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,840
He did it

555
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,640
after an all-night

556
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,160
in prayer.

557
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,260
One of the earliest prayers

558
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,860
that I learned

559
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,520
in childhood,

560
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,700
this thing Abba,

561
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,660
it's the Hebrew word

562
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,520
which means Father.

563
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,140
It's never been

564
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,280
translated into English.

565
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,440
It's like the word

566
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,180
Amen is Hebrew,

567
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,040
the word Alleluia

568
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,440
is Hebrew.

569
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,400
Hosanna Hebrew

570
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,840
stays in the Hebrew language.

571
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,900
Did you learn

572
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,460
that prayer

573
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,960
Abba,

574
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,220
Lieber,

575
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,560
Fater,

576
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,520
Father,

577
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,480
dear Father,

578
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:27,820
oh,

579
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,600
and we can cry

580
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,980
again by means

581
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,780
of the Holy Spirit

582
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,000
to God as our Father.

583
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,960
We can face life erect

584
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,980
because God says

585
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,080
that I'll work

586
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,820
everything for your good.

587
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,980
Who are the sons of God

588
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,140
and the children of God?

589
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,440
Oh, again,

590
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
those are fighting words

591
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
to some individuals.

592
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,100
Some say,

593
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,260
I don't care what you say.

594
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,240
If I'm a human being,

595
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,220
I'm a son of God.

596
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
But God doesn't say so.

597
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,440
You and I are not

598
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,400
children of God

599
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,180
simply because

600
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,400
we are human beings.

601
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,140
We are children of God

602
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
only when we are led

603
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,860
by the Holy Spirit

604
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,160
because He is the must.

605
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,840
In a man's life,

606
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,480
if a man is a son of God,

607
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,540
it's the Holy Spirit

608
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,060
who must be there.

609
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,200
He is the essential.

610
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,560
Why?

611
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,940
He's not only the one

612
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,360
that makes us sons of God

613
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,180
who enables us

614
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,460
to claim God as Father,

615
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,540
but He's the one also

616
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,940
that bears witness

617
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,740
with our spirit

618
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,380
that we are children of God.

619
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,240
What witness does a man have

620
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,480
that he is a son of God

621
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
if he's basing it

622
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,100
merely on the fact

623
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,040
that he's a human being?

624
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
Oh, I know that a lot of us

625
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,360
have it.

626
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,740
How many of us have said this?

627
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,640
I'm just as good

628
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,280
as anybody else

629
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
who goes to church.

630
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,000
You see,

631
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,040
we try to justify

632
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,180
the fact that I'm a human being.

633
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,560
There are,

634
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm a child of God

635
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,420
just as much

636
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,320
as anybody is

637
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,260
that goes to church.

638
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,860
You ever have your neighbor say,

639
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm just as good

640
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,600
as anybody who goes to church.

641
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't care if you're

642
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,220
a big bunch of hypocrites,

643
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,280
that's why you go.

644
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,860
We ought to remind them,

645
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,360
come on in,

646
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
there's room for one more.

647
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,440
But again,

648
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
this thing of what you do

649
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,720
and I'm better than you are,

650
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,400
isn't it strange?

651
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,000
We try to justify ourselves

652
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,220
that we are sons of God

653
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,980
because we are human beings

654
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,660
and then, of course,

655
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,300
we're always better

656
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,200
than a lot of people.

657
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,660
Supposing we are.

658
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,520
Strange, though, isn't it,

659
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,820
that we always compare ourselves

660
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,280
with somebody

661
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,100
that we know is worse.

662
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,240
We never compare ourselves

663
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,700
with somebody

664
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,780
that is superior, do we?

665
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,820
But as you come out

666
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,780
on the short end on that,

667
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,560
and that's no fun,

668
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:12,980
isn't it?

669
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,360
That's no fun.

670
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,780
How many of us

671
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,380
justify ourselves

672
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,680
and try to verify

673
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,820
something within us

674
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,300
that we are sons of God

675
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,140
because we're human beings?

676
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,040
We don't get very far,

677
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,360
do we,

678
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,820
especially when we face death

679
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,860
or especially

680
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,980
if we're honest enough

681
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,160
to face our sins.

682
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,460
When we begin

683
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,480
to face our sins,

684
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,800
then something happens.

685
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,320
But when, again,

686
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
the Holy Spirit

687
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
causes you and me

688
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,180
to have to our souls

689
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,860
the testimony

690
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,940
that we are children of God,

691
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,620
what does he do?

692
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,660
Through the Word of God,

693
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,560
he testifies to us

694
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,660
because we have repented

695
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,420
of our sins,

696
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,160
because we have put

697
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,260
our trust in Christ

698
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,440
that we are saved.

699
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,200
And in thousands

700
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,260
of scripture passages,

701
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,300
he comes to us

702
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,860
in the Word,

703
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,980
assuring us

704
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,780
that because Christ

705
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,680
died for everyone,

706
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,420
therefore he died

707
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,300
for you and for me,

708
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,560
because his was

709
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,740
an eternal sacrifice,

710
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,160
because it was

711
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,860
for all men,

712
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,140
therefore you and I

713
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,860
are included,

714
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,640
though whosoever

715
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,380
the Word of God

716
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,300
is so broad

717
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,540
and that it includes

718
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,300
every man

719
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,840
and there are

720
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,300
thousands of testimonies

721
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,960
that the Holy Spirit

722
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,800
brings to you and me

723
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,300
through the Word

724
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,900
that we are children of God

725
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,980
and that because

726
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,960
we are children of God,

727
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,120
then the glorious status

728
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,140
that we are heirs of God

729
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,480
and joint heirs

730
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
with Christ

731
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,440
of eternal life.

732
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,020
Think of the status

733
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,280
of sons yet.

734
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,900
The man without

735
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,980
Jesus Christ,

736
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,840
the man without

737
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,660
the Holy Spirit

738
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,640
may argue all

739
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,200
he wants

740
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,060
and can say,

741
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,980
I'm a human being,

742
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,800
therefore I'm a child

743
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,280
of God

744
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
and that only

745
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,460
the man that has

746
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,620
the must in his life,

747
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,560
the Holy Spirit,

748
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,020
can say that

749
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,080
because the Holy Spirit

750
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,700
has caused him

751
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
to be born again

752
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,480
to come to a living

753
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,400
trust in Christ,

754
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,480
that he is an heir

755
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,980
of God

756
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,680
and a joint heir

757
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,100
with Christ.

758
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,100
Think of what it must mean

759
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,120
to be an heir of God,

760
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,720
to be a joint heir

761
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,300
with Christ,

762
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,000
God's only begotten Son,

763
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,580
an heir of eternal life.

764
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,640
Oh, how we hold on

765
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,760
tenaciously to life,

766
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,200
don't we,

767
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,020
and we want it

768
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,120
and when death

769
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,380
comes to a loved one again,

770
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,400
the sorrows that come

771
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,620
because life is sweet

772
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,300
then being an heir

773
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,740
of God

774
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,140
means life forevermore.

775
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,660
What must it mean?

776
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,000
Is it any wonder

777
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,760
that Scripture says,

778
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,740
I have not seen

779
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,300
nor ear heard

780
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,900
neither have entered

781
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,000
into the heart of man

782
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,020
the things which God

783
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,980
has prepared for them

784
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,680
that love him

785
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,220
to have life,

786
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,720
abundant life,

787
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,900
life forevermore.

788
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,480
Now that's what we

789
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,220
inherit in Jesus Christ,

790
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,560
sons of God,

791
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,620
not mere again

792
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,860
creatures of God

793
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,340
because those are

794
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,460
words that burn.

795
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,120
we ought to say

796
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,880
to ourselves,

797
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,700
we are not

798
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,220
sons of God

799
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,080
because we are

800
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,060
human beings.

801
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,140
We are sons of God

802
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,900
only as we are led

803
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
by the Holy Spirit

804
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,960
that God's Spirit

805
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,340
dwells in our hearts

806
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,260
by faith.

807
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,740
And in order to know

808
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,580
whether he is there,

809
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,520
we ought to ask him,

810
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,120
what's our attitude

811
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,300
towards the word of God?

812
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,840
How did we feel

813
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,740
in coming to church

814
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,340
this morning?

815
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,580
I wonder if we get up

816
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:55,980
on Sunday

817
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,000
and ever say to ourselves,

818
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,880
this is the day

819
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,460
which the Lord

820
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,960
is made,

821
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,780
we will rejoice

822
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,840
and be glad in it.

823
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,180
Or is going to church

824
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,100
a humdrum thing

825
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,740
that it's a matter

826
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,160
of duty

827
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,800
we can't reel

828
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,360
it over with

829
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,920
to get out?

830
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,240
Or do we come to church

831
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,580
and say,

832
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,020
thank God the Holy Spirit

833
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,000
through the word of God

834
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,700
that will be preached

835
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,420
will bear witness

836
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,140
with my spirit

837
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,420
that I am a child of God

838
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,840
and when I am a child

839
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,160
of God,

840
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,280
nothing else matters

841
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,080
and can we go out

842
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,680
of church feeling

843
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,660
that we have confronted

844
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,120
God,

845
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,860
that we have seen

846
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,600
him in his word.

847
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,860
That we go out

848
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,880
as sons of God

849
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,900
holding our heads

850
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,000
high in him

851
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
because he is our father

852
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,340
and he understands.

853
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,400
Paul said again

854
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
that when the spirit

855
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
bears witness

856
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,460
with our spirit

857
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,840
we are the sons of God

858
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,660
and then there is

859
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,940
joy in suffering.

860
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,520
But what's happened?

861
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,800
What's happened?

862
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,920
Why is it that the world

863
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,200
doesn't hate the church

864
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,880
as the world

865
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,120
ought to hate the church?

866
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,420
Maybe some of you

867
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,400
this morning say,

868
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't believe

869
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,720
what you're saying.

870
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,540
Maybe some of you

871
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,160
are saying,

872
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,000
if what you are saying

873
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,460
is true

874
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,540
that only they

875
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,680
are children of God

876
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,820
who have the Holy Spirit

877
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,320
and I don't have

878
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,900
the Holy Spirit

879
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,820
to see what that does

880
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,080
to you,

881
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,000
it makes you lost,

882
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,500
doesn't it?

883
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,880
No man likes that.

884
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,920
There is a stigma

885
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,040
that is attached

886
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,280
to being a Christian,

887
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,500
a child of God

888
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,060
and belonging

889
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,740
to the church.

890
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,120
What's happening

891
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,920
in America

892
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,640
that the world

893
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,420
loves the church

894
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,280
like it loves it?

895
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,500
Why is it that

896
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,280
belonging to the church

897
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,600
today is a status symbol?

898
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,460
Everybody belongs

899
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:19,900
to the church.

900
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,500
It's grand.

901
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,180
The big thing is

902
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,980
find out the one

903
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,420
where your social standing

904
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,480
will be a little larger.

905
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,800
That's the big thing today.

906
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,380
It's the thing to do

907
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,340
to go to church.

908
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,740
The world

909
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,040
ought to hate the church

910
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,500
because the church

911
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,600
says to the world,

912
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,840
you may be a human being

913
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,980
but unless you are led

914
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,960
by the Spirit of God,

915
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
you are not God's son,

916
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,900
you are damned.

917
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,800
Those ought to be

918
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,820
fighting words.

919
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,080
What's happened

920
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,940
to the church?

921
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,220
Oh, in this great

922
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,260
ecumenical movement

923
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,240
that is going on,

924
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,360
certainly it'd be wonderful

925
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
if the church were one.

926
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,800
But I'm wondering

927
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,460
if the church

928
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,300
in its desire

929
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,180
to be one

930
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,500
is forgetting

931
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,280
the message

932
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,380
that it has

933
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,280
and that's a two-edged sword.

934
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,360
The message

935
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,600
that cuts to the quick

936
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,540
that tells the man

937
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,040
of the world

938
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,700
without the Holy Spirit

939
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,660
you're not a child

940
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,040
of God

941
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,200
regardless of what you say,

942
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,740
you're lost,

943
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,420
you're damned.

944
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,640
That should make

945
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,540
a man hate the church.

946
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,240
Look at Paul.

947
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
On his first missionary

948
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,800
journey with Barnabas

949
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,540
when they come over

950
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,640
again to the island of Cyprus,

951
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
came up into Asia Minor,

952
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,760
remember when they came

953
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,860
to a place called Derbe

954
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,300
and when Paul was there

955
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,900
here were people

956
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,660
worshiping idols

957
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,520
and he healed a man

958
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
that had been crippled

959
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
from his mother's womb

960
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,580
and they began

961
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,400
to worship Paul

962
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,980
and Barnabas

963
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,620
as though they were

964
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,760
gods in human flesh

965
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
and they called Barnabas

966
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,540
Jupiter

967
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,180
and they called

968
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,900
Paul Mercury

969
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,220
because he was the spokesman

970
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,740
and they began

971
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,240
to offer sacrifices

972
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,580
and Paul stopped them

973
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,440
and he said

974
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,340
we're only human beings

975
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,280
and then Paul preached

976
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,820
the gospel

977
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,780
but what did he tell them

978
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,320
at this time?

979
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,500
He told them

980
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,080
that only in Jesus Christ

981
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,760
does a man

982
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,980
become a child of God

983
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,340
and then because

984
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,860
he had said

985
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,660
the same message

986
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,400
over in Iconium

987
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,440
they came from Iconium

988
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,300
they got a hold of Paul

989
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,920
and they took him out

990
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
and they stoned him

991
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,740
as far as they were concerned

992
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,860
they killed him

993
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,580
because of the stigma

994
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,520
of being a Christian

995
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,780
they thought he was dead

996
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,880
after being stoned

997
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,700
but he got up

998
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,020
there must have been

999
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,620
a young man

1000
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,340
who was watching

1001
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,140
because when Paul

1002
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,980
came back to Derbe

1003
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,100
he picked up the young man

1004
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,340
you know

1005
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,520
became a great war horse

1006
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,220
in the church too

1007
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,720
Timothy

1008
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,500
Timothy must have seen

1009
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,200
all that

1010
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,240
and again

1011
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,760
he went on

1012
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,420
carrying the torch

1013
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,400
but when Paul

1014
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,500
preached the essence

1015
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,300
of the gospel

1016
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,080
and let it be seen

1017
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,140
that only the man

1018
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,220
that has Christ

1019
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,900
is a child of God

1020
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,960
they tried to kill him

1021
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
it's the stigma

1022
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,420
of the cross

1023
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,180
nobody's killing

1024
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,780
anybody else

1025
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,560
in America today

1026
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,060
are we

1027
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,520
because somehow

1028
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:34,840
or other

1029
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,320
the church

1030
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,660
has gotten so soft

1031
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,780
and so supine

1032
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,040
and so self-sufficient

1033
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,340
that the world

1034
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,360
says that'll never

1035
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,060
harm us

1036
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,000
we're just alright

1037
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,540
too

1038
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,200
whether you're in

1039
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,920
or whether you're out

1040
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,740
have you ever been

1041
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,260
in a place

1042
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,240
where it was a stigma

1043
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,940
to be a Christian

1044
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,120
last summer

1045
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,140
I was in a nation

1046
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,180
where to be a Christian

1047
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,240
was a stigma

1048
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,800
we were in a restaurant

1049
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
in a certain city

1050
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,700
a very nice restaurant

1051
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,420
we had had our meal

1052
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,940
and right up a few stairs

1053
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,400
from the main part

1054
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,860
of the restaurant

1055
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,080
there was a grand piano

1056
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,180
standing there

1057
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,060
and one of our party

1058
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,720
of 25

1059
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,860
a school teacher

1060
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,460
walked over

1061
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,420
and sat down

1062
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,140
at the piano

1063
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,100
and began to play

1064
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,820
very fine pianist

1065
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,760
also by the way

1066
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,120
she began to play

1067
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,640
a popular number

1068
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,540
of we sing here

1069
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,420
in the United States

1070
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,340
it had an electrifying

1071
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,760
effect in that restaurant

1072
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,180
I was amazed

1073
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,740
that they know

1074
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,640
our popular music

1075
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,740
and they began to sing

1076
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,460
and the waiters

1077
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,060
stood there

1078
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,080
and they watched

1079
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,020
and there was approval

1080
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,220
and there was applause

1081
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,060
as she played

1082
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,700
from one number

1083
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,200
to the other

1084
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,860
then as she modulated

1085
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,960
from one song

1086
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,520
to the other

1087
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,980
she started to play

1088
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,240
a Christian hymn

1089
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,920
and when she started

1090
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,280
to play the Christian hymn

1091
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,140
and some of us

1092
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,480
sang rather softly

1093
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,620
the silence

1094
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,780
in that restaurant

1095
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,740
was deaf

1096
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,180
everybody stood there

1097
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,200
there was a glare

1098
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,820
because they hated

1099
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,480
Jesus Christ

1100
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
I know

1101
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,620
what the stigma

1102
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,940
of the cross is

1103
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,400
I felt it

1104
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,880
key

1105
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,180
just get

1106
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,220
some place

1107
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,840
where Christ

1108
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,440
is he

1109
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,240
where other religions

1110
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,500
have taken the place

1111
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,940
and you begin

1112
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,720
to realize

1113
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,960
the world

1114
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,780
ought to eat

1115
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,460
the church

1116
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,040
because the church

1117
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,020
and I can't speak

1118
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,780
in any plain

1119
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,020
or says to a man

1120
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,820
just because

1121
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,980
you're a human being

1122
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,460
you may be

1123
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,640
a fine human being

1124
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,900
that doesn't make

1125
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,760
you a child

1126
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,420
of God

1127
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,180
you're lost

1128
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,680
you've got

1129
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,560
to have

1130
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
the Holy Spirit

1131
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,820
you've got

1132
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,440
to come

1133
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,460
to a conviction

1134
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,240
of sin

1135
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,600
and you've got

1136
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,100
to come

1137
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,700
to a living

1138
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,900
trust in Jesus

1139
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,680
Christ

1140
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,920
or you're lost

1141
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,020
those are

1142
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,100
fighting words

1143
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,240
that's the stigma

1144
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
of the cross

1145
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
but when God

1146
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
is our father

1147
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,040
we ought to

1148
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,680
walk the glory

1149
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,020
road

1150
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,400
and we ought

1151
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,120
to say to ourselves

1152
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,980
am I a soldier

1153
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,760
of the cross

1154
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,060
a follower

1155
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,840
of the lamb

1156
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
shall I blush

1157
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,120
to own his cause

1158
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,900
or even to speak

1159
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,560
his name

1160
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
must I be carried

1161
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,460
to the skies

1162
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,780
on flowery beds

1163
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,240
of ease

1164
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,880
while others

1165
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,600
fought to win

1166
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,460
the prize

1167
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,960
and sailed

1168
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,400
through blood

1169
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,700
he sees

1170
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,540
am I a soldier

1171
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,260
of the cross

1172
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,180
we ought to realize

1173
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,000
that to be a son

1174
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,460
of God

1175
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,480
means to be a soldier

1176
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,140
of the cross

1177
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,400
but to walk

1178
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,260
the glory road

1179
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,160
in this conviction

1180
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,540
this is still

1181
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,720
our father's

1182
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,020
world

1183
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,720
isn't it

1184
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
this is my

1185
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,000
father's world

1186
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,940
why should my

1187
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,040
heart be sad

1188
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,860
isn't it time

1189
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,560
that the message

1190
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,740
of Jesus Christ

1191
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,680
becomes so

1192
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,240
pertinent

1193
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,940
and sharp

1194
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,600
that at least

1195
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,320
the man of the world

1196
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,900
knows that we're

1197
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,780
talking about it

1198
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,760
if some of you

1199
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,820
hate me this morning

1200
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
because I have

1201
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,800
told you that

1202
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,560
just because

1203
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,240
you're a human

1204
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,820
being

1205
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,100
you are not

1206
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,060
the son of God

1207
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,800
that's the

1208
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,920
stigma of the cross

1209
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,480
but my prayer

1210
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,940
is

1211
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,320
that you'll not

1212
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,000
go out of this

1213
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,980
church this morning

1214
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,560
but what you

1215
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,200
will ask the

1216
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,840
Holy Spirit

1217
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,060
to bring you

1218
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,940
to a conviction

1219
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,480
of sin

1220
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,160
and to a living

1221
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,280
trust in Jesus

1222
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,800
Christ

1223
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,360
that you can

1224
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
go out of church

1225
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,220
and know the joy

1226
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,280
of what it means

1227
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,160
to be a son of God

1228
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,640
Amen

1229
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,480
The peace of God

1230
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,160
which passeth

1231
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,480
all human understanding

1232
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,540
keep and unite

1233
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,700
your hearts and minds

1234
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,760
in Christ Jesus

1235
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,440
unto life everlasting
