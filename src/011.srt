1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Let us be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,400
Let us hear the word of God taken from our epistolary lesson for this Sunday,

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,460
written in Paul's letter to the Ephesians, reading there in the fifth chapter, the seventeenth verse.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,600
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,980
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,840
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:49,700
Sons and daughters of the Protestant Reformation, in Christ Jesus, dear friends,

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,360
you who are here in God's house this morning, and you also, Christian friends,

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,820
who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,720
This coming Thursday marks the 446th anniversary of the great Protestant Reformation.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:19,560
It was on October the 31st, 1517, that a young Augustinian monk by the name of Martin Luther

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:29,600
nailed on to the castle door of the church in Wittenberg in Germany 95 theses or propositions.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:39,500
And those hammer blows, believe me, Christian friends, rocked the earth to its very foundations.

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:48,500
Those hammer blows that day changed the entire course of human events in this world.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:59,460
And all because those 95 theses or propositions had at their heart and center this question,

16
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,300
what is the way to heaven?

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,740
What is the way of salvation?

18
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,180
What is the way to eternal life?

19
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:17,800
And Martin Luther, in those propositions, proclaimed a way of salvation that was new.

20
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,000
It was different than the accepted way of his day.

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,620
That's why those hammer blows rocked the very earth on which you and I walk.

22
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:39,480
And today, as we stand, 446 years later, and we say to ourselves, what does that mean to me?

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,600
And above all, we look at it and we say, is it possible, therefore,

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,620
since Martin Luther announced a new way of salvation,

25
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,820
one that was different from the accepted way of his day,

26
00:02:51,820 --> 00:03:00,240
is it possible today to come to the unvarnished truth with regard to the way to heaven?

27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,420
Is it possible to really know the truth?

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,460
Is it possible to have the unadulterated truth?

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
This is the way to heaven.

30
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,460
I read as my text the word of God from the apostle Paul to the congregation at Ephesus.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,760
And there in writing to them he says these words,

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,620
Wherefore, he says, be ye not unwise.

33
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,860
Wherefore, don't be fools, he tells the Ephesian Christians,

34
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,220
but understand what the will of the Lord is.

35
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,660
Understand and know the will of the Lord.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,500
In other words, what is the will of the Lord?

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,640
What is the way of salvation?

38
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,520
What is his will with regard to the way of eternal life?

39
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,640
And when Paul calls upon you and me through the word of God that we are not to be fools,

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,060
that you and I are to be wise and therefore we are to understand the will of God with regard to the way of salvation,

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,060
let's realize this, that it is possible, it is not beyond our grasp,

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,600
it is not beyond our reach,

43
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,960
that today, 446 years later,

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,960
we can ask ourselves,

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,180
What is the truth in this matter?

46
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,660
What is the way to heaven and to eternal life?

47
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,380
It is within our grasp because in the first place,

48
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,600
God has given us his scriptures wherein is made known the way to heaven.

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,400
Martin Luther wondered what is the way of salvation.

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,740
He wondered,

51
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,060
Is it the way I have been taught?

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,640
Is it the way I have been told?

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Is it what others have told me?

54
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,500
Is it what the church says?

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,860
Is it what the church has decreed in its counsels and in its decisions?

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Martin Luther said,

57
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,080
I am going to turn to the Bible.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,540
Why?

59
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,100
Because he found in the Bible that the apostle Paul,

60
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,560
writing to the young Timothy,

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,280
had said these words in his second letter.

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:57,980
He said,

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,100
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and been approved of,

64
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,940
that not from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,920
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Martin Luther knows that in the scriptures a man becomes wise to salvation.

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,320
A man in the scriptures no longer is a fool,

68
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,400
that he turns to the scriptures and he finds the way of salvation.

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,920
Because Paul had said to Timothy,

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,920
Again,

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,780
Thou hast known the holy scriptures from a child,

72
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,220
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

73
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,100
Because he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,680
All scripture is given by the authority of God,

75
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,140
that God's spirit has moved men to write,

76
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,280
that they have written what God wants them to write without error.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
This is the inspired, the infallible word.

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,320
And therefore Paul told Timothy,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,060
And it is profitable for doctrine to find out the truth,

80
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,220
for an instruction, again,

81
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,360
that the man of God may be perfect,

82
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,840
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

83
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,980
And so Luther turned to the word of God,

84
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,940
to the inspired writings.

85
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,240
What do the scriptures say?

86
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,460
This is the only authority.

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,340
This is the only inspired and infallible authority we have.

88
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,020
Again, he knew that Christ had preached on earth.

89
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,560
There was no New Testament when Jesus was preaching.

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,700
Again, Christ preached and then came the apostles.

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,160
They had the Old Testament.

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,420
But when again they had preached,

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,100
we say to ourselves,

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,160
What did they preach?

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,580
Do you realize Jesus never wrote a word,

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,560
as far as we know?

97
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,840
We have no record of any writing of Jesus.

98
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,980
It was written for him.

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,740
The Holy Spirit therefore wrote down what Jesus had taught

100
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,440
and what the disciples had preached,

101
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,840
that you and I might know the truth.

102
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,800
Jesus said,

103
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,520
If you continue in my word,

104
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
you shall know the truth,

105
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,260
and the truth shall make you free.

106
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,920
And therefore God's Holy Spirit wrote down for us

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,700
that we have the New Testament.

108
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,640
There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,240
who gave us written records of the life of Jesus.

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,840
There was the book of Acts,

111
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,160
the history of the Christian church of the first century,

112
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,520
written by Luke,

113
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,040
the only Gentile writer of the New Testament.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,460
And then came the letters that Paul wrote

115
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,780
by inspiration of God

116
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,520
as he went on his three missionary journeys

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,500
in established Christian congregations.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,720
The letter to the Romans that we have.

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
First and second Corinthians

120
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,260
is letter to the congregation at Corinth in Greece.

121
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,260
Galatians,

122
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,060
the letter to the Galatian Christians

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,720
up in the province of Asia Minor.

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,360
And then Philippians up in Macedonia

125
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,320
where Lydia, the seller of purple, lived,

126
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,880
you recall.

127
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,300
And in Thessalonica in Greece.

128
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,200
And again,

129
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,040
then the letters to Timothy

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
and to Titus

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
and to Philemon

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,900
and the book of Hebrews.

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Whether Paul wrote it,

134
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,180
we do not know.

135
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,900
But again,

136
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,820
this is the letter to the Jewish Christians.

137
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,440
And then we have the letter

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,900
again of James,

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
the brother of the Lord,

140
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,400
and of Jude,

141
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,300
the brother of the Lord.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,300
The two letters

143
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
that the Apostle Peter has left us.

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
The three letters of John

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
besides the Gospel.

146
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
And then finally,

147
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,700
the revelation,

148
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,460
the Apocalypse.

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,660
God has given us this record

150
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,160
by inspiration.

151
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,960
And it was Martin Luther

152
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,460
that went to the Word of God

153
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,940
and said,

154
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,940
what does the Word of God say?

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,360
This is the one

156
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,140
and this is the only authority.

157
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,700
And you and I have it.

158
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,460
And therefore,

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,620
we can say today,

160
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,600
446 years later,

161
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,000
this Bible is open to you

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,580
and to me

163
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,360
and to all men

164
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,020
to go and find out

165
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,800
for ourselves

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,760
what does the Word of God say

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,460
as regards the way to heaven

168
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,780
and the way to eternal life.

169
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,540
At the time of the Reformation

170
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,480
under Martin Luther,

171
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,700
movable type

172
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,640
had been invented

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,040
by Gutenberg.

174
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,680
And therefore,

175
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,220
when there came

176
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,020
movable type,

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,240
here was an opportunity

178
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,460
to print the Bible.

179
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,400
Luther went to the Wartburg

180
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,620
and there he spent time

181
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,040
translating the entire Bible

182
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
into the language

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,960
of the German people.

184
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,560
Think of it.

185
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,680
What a colossal,

186
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,860
gigantic task.

187
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,080
The Old Testament,

188
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,820
39 books written in Hebrew,

189
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,360
translating them into German.

190
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,500
The 27 books of the New Testament

191
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,660
written originally in Greek,

192
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
translating them into German.

193
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,720
When the German language

194
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,700
didn't have the word,

195
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,860
he invented the word.

196
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,700
A friend and colleague of mine

197
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,480
just coming back

198
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,140
from Helsinki

199
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,360
where the Lutheran World

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,340
Federation was held,

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,540
came with a party

202
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,480
into East Germany

203
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,100
and he went to Isleben

204
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,060
where Luther was born

205
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,180
and went over to Wittenberg

206
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,040
and they went to

207
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,000
the Wartburg Castle

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
where Luther translated

209
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,720
the Bible

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,760
into the language

211
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,860
of the common people.

212
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,220
And a communist guide said,

213
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,820
here is where a man

214
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,120
by the name of Martin Luther

215
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
invented the German language.

216
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
That is all communism

217
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
will say about him.

218
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,320
But Martin Luther did more

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,700
than invent the German language.

220
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,120
He translated the Bible

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,940
into the language

222
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,540
of the people

223
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,560
that the people

224
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,860
might have the opportunity

225
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,400
to go to the word of God

226
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
and find out

227
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
what is this way

228
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,620
of salvation.

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,040
True,

230
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,520
446 years ago

231
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,260
Martin Luther

232
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,300
did announce

233
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,020
and promulgate

234
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,660
a new way of salvation.

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,660
It was new in this

236
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,560
that it was different

237
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
than the accepted way

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,460
but it really wasn't new.

239
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,460
It was the way

240
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,240
of scriptures.

241
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,880
And that's why today

242
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,660
as we stand

243
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,500
446 years later

244
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,720
we ought to say

245
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,420
to ourselves

246
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,120
since Paul calls upon us

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,140
not to be fools

248
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,240
but understand

249
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,620
what the will of God is

250
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,180
know it

251
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,660
know the unvarnished truth

252
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,960
we ought to determine

253
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,640
that that's what we want

254
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,500
and if we want it

255
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,200
badly enough

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,060
then we would familiarize

257
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,540
ourselves

258
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,900
with the word of God.

259
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,420
How many of us

260
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,840
are content

261
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
to take the minister's word

262
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,600
for it?

263
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,440
Content to take

264
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,420
what the church says?

265
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,540
Content to take

266
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,820
what other individuals say

267
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,440
as regards

268
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,220
the way to heaven?

269
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,720
The greatest question

270
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,940
the most important question

271
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,000
in your life and mine.

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,480
I was interested

273
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,020
in reading

274
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,380
that Cardinal Joseph

275
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,760
Sittler

276
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,660
from the Archdiocese

277
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,500
of St. Louis

278
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,800
when Cardinal Ritter

279
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,520
is his name

280
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,420
when Cardinal Ritter

281
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,360
was over at the

282
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,280
second assembly

283
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,220
of the ecumenical conference

284
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,920
in Rome

285
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,140
Cardinal Ritter

286
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,220
who is the Archbishop

287
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,140
of St. Louis

288
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,340
in that cathedral

289
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,080
where I have been

290
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,940
many a time

291
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,540
he made this speech

292
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,200
in Rome

293
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,980
and he called

294
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,160
upon his church

295
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,300
he said this

296
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
when he was asked

297
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,760
what does the church need?

298
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,540
he said

299
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,440
my church

300
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,460
must go back

301
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,480
to more preaching

302
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,780
it must have

303
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,400
the preaching

304
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,580
of the word of God

305
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,480
there is too much

306
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
liturgy in the church

307
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
there isn't enough

308
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
preaching of the word of God

309
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
and to that I say

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,100
yea and amen

311
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,620
because that's

312
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,180
what every church needs

313
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,800
is preaching

314
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,780
of the word of God

315
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,920
I was in

316
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
St. Peter's Cathedral

317
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,860
on a Sunday morning

318
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,420
in Rome

319
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,280
and again

320
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,840
they were building

321
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,400
the bleachers

322
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,580
for the ecumenical meeting

323
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,680
they were sawing wood

324
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,280
and hammering

325
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,320
you couldn't hear yourself

326
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,740
think

327
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,320
when you're in the cathedrals

328
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,620
you say

329
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,880
how could anybody be heard?

330
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
well they were not built

331
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,880
to be preached in

332
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
they were not built

333
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,540
to be heard in

334
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,380
because in the rendition

335
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,020
of a liturgy

336
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
you don't have to hear much

337
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,560
there is no preaching

338
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,340
and therefore again

339
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,060
they are built

340
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,380
to preach in

341
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,160
that's what God wants

342
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,220
and when the church

343
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,160
of Jesus Christ

344
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,380
whether it's Roman Catholic

345
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,460
or whether it's Lutheran

346
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
or what have you

347
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,880
goes back to a preaching

348
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
of the word of God

349
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,940
then and only then

350
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,720
shall we come

351
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,700
to that untarnished truth

352
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,760
and that certainty

353
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,080
as regards

354
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,420
the way of salvation

355
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,000
that's what we need

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,060
I know Lutheran ministers

357
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,040
who have said to me

358
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,300
give me the liturgy

359
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,480
and you can omit the sermon

360
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
listen liturgy

361
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
is all right

362
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,300
but sometimes

363
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,220
I change it

364
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,000
and put it into

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,460
20th century vernacular

366
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,740
and then you sit up

367
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,420
and you act like

368
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,960
you're awake

369
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,920
and you take part

370
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,940
and the organist wonders

371
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,220
will I get my cue?

372
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,480
but again

373
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,820
it can get humdrum

374
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,640
yes liturgy

375
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,460
is all right

376
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,640
but it can never

377
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,500
take the place

378
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,160
of the preaching

379
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,540
of the word of God

380
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,560
that's exactly

381
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,060
what we need

382
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,900
and again

383
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,760
thank God

384
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,480
for anybody

385
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,720
who wants to put it

386
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,640
back in the church

387
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,980
because if there's

388
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
going to be unity

389
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,620
it's going to have

390
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,340
to be unity

391
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,100
on the basis

392
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,400
of the word of God

393
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,880
and the biggest question

394
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,000
that faces you and me

395
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,980
is simply this one

396
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,500
what is the way to heaven?

397
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,220
446 years ago

398
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,060
Martin Luther

399
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,140
in his theses

400
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,520
announced a new

401
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,540
way of salvation

402
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,340
it was new

403
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,960
in that it was

404
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,520
different from

405
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,560
the accepted way

406
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,900
and as you and I

407
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,600
stand here

408
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,520
over four centuries

409
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,260
later and say

410
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,760
to ourselves

411
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,820
can we come

412
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,520
to certainty

413
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,380
and know the

414
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,320
unbiredest truth

415
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,960
we can

416
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,380
why?

417
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,920
not only because

418
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,580
again God

419
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,220
has given us

420
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,720
the scriptures

421
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,580
when it's revealed

422
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,000
the way

423
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,460
but in the second place

424
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,260
these scriptures

425
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,640
that God has given us

426
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,400
they testify

427
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,240
that we are saved

428
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
by grace

429
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,120
alone

430
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
that salvation

431
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,940
is by grace

432
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,420
alone

433
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,560
you may say

434
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:33,920
preacher

435
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,000
what do you mean

436
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,860
grace alone

437
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,560
you may say

438
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,380
you men

439
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,440
preach in language

440
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,220
that we can't

441
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,720
understand

442
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,740
and it goes

443
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,140
overhead

444
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,300
well what good

445
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,860
is preaching

446
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,480
if it's over

447
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,060
what do you mean

448
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,380
by grace alone

449
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,940
Paul says

450
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,500
when he wrote

451
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,380
to the Ephesians

452
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,340
we are saved

453
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,120
by grace

454
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,920
by grace

455
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,140
what do you mean

456
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,580
grace

457
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,560
think of

458
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,340
grace is

459
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,060
the undeserved

460
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,800
love of God

461
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,640
it's the mercy

462
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,500
of God

463
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,580
let's get at it

464
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:58,900
this way

465
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,460
did you ever buy

466
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,320
a package of

467
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
food of some kind

468
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,420
either in a can

469
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,580
or in a package

470
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,840
and it's set on the label

471
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,560
untouched by human hand

472
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm sure you have

473
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,660
where it again

474
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,340
would have you know

475
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,520
that no human hand

476
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,260
touched this

477
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,900
this was prepared

478
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,840
exclusively

479
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,560
without a human hand

480
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,540
having touched it

481
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,080
use that for a moment

482
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,940
I think it will become

483
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,840
clear what we mean

484
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,600
by salvation

485
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,720
by grace alone

486
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,960
salvation by grace alone

487
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,640
means this

488
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,740
it is untouched

489
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,840
by human hand

490
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
let me put it this way

491
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,580
salvation by grace

492
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,660
by the mercy of God

493
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,340
means this

494
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,500
that salvation

495
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,440
was bought

496
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,700
and paid for

497
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,320
packaged

498
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,300
and ready

499
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,260
for you and me

500
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,720
before you or I

501
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,680
were ever born

502
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,420
does that help

503
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,760
you and I

504
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,620
never touched it

505
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,780
salvation

506
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,800
eternal life

507
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,480
deliverance

508
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,020
from hell

509
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,800
and damnation

510
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,720
has all been bought

511
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,520
and paid

512
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
and packaged

513
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
without you and I

514
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,640
ever having

515
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,620
touched it

516
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,500
no human being

517
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
it is ready

518
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,480
and has been

519
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880
before we were

520
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,740
ever born

521
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,340
we had

522
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,840
nothing to do

523
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,160
with it

524
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,520
whatever

525
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,260
that's what

526
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,080
grace means

527
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,420
why

528
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,840
because the love

529
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,480
of God

530
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
this mercy of his

531
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,300
when God saw

532
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,560
that we could not

533
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,500
have anything to do

534
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:11,760
with it

535
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,380
that you and I

536
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,180
could not save

537
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,680
ourselves

538
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,060
God sent his son

539
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,820
Jesus Christ

540
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,600
into the world

541
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,500
and he went

542
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
to Calvary's cross

543
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,340
and there is

544
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,780
the God

545
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,180
man

546
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,880
true God

547
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
and true man

548
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,040
he bore the guilt

549
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,720
and the punishment

550
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,500
of your sins

551
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:24,960
and mine

552
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,980
all of the guilt

553
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,720
and all of the

554
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,140
punishment

555
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,780
he bore the guilt

556
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,440
of your coming

557
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
into this world

558
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,740
in sin

559
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,340
and I coming

560
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,100
into this world

561
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,620
in sin

562
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,060
he bore the guilt

563
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,940
of our mortal

564
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,680
and again

565
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,540
of our venial

566
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:36,960
sins

567
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,940
he bore the guilt

568
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,980
of every thought

569
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,780
word and deed

570
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,440
of you and me

571
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,060
before we were

572
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,620
ever born

573
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,280
it was all

574
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
bought and paid

575
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
for in the

576
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,340
sufferings and

577
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,300
death of Jesus

578
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,820
Christ

579
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,920
he bore the

580
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,620
equal of an

581
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,720
eternity in hell

582
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,980
untouched by

583
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,880
human hands

584
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,620
that is before

585
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,240
you and I

586
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,900
were ever born

587
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,620
that's what it

588
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,020
means

589
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,040
we are saved

590
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,460
by grace

591
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,300
does that help

592
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,380
and that means

593
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,040
this then

594
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,280
that this salvation

595
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,140
that this word

596
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,240
of God proclaims

597
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,140
that is by grace

598
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,500
alone

599
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
has been bought

600
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,860
and paid for

601
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,560
and packaged

602
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,740
and made ready

603
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,960
for the entire

604
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
human race

605
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,400
from the time

606
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,840
of Adam

607
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,520
to the last

608
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:12,920
child

609
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,440
that will ever

610
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,900
be born

611
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,280
of woman

612
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,740
that's what

613
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,380
grace means

614
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,400
but you and I

615
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,960
may have a little

616
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,320
problem

617
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,760
we may say

618
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
well I can see

619
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,860
where it's bought

620
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,360
and paid for

621
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,680
for me

622
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,340
because I live

623
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,100
after Calvary

624
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,140
how about those

625
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,780
who lived before

626
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,240
Calvary

627
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,780
well the Bible

628
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,880
answers that one too

629
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
because it tells us

630
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
that Jesus Christ

631
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,820
Calvary

632
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,980
he was the lamb

633
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,480
slain

634
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,860
before the foundation

635
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,840
of the world

636
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,260
in the eyes of God

637
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,220
it was a timeless

638
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,820
sacrifice

639
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,600
and Christ

640
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,320
in the eyes

641
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
of his heavenly father

642
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
was slain

643
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,380
even before Adam

644
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,120
was created

645
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,720
therefore

646
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
salvation

647
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
eternal life

648
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,620
for Adam

649
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,000
and Eve

650
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,540
were bought

651
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,840
and paid for

652
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
and absolutely

653
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,560
boxed and packaged

654
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,420
for Adam

655
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:49,800
and Eve

656
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,440
before they were

657
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,020
ever created

658
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,700
does that help

659
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,660
that's what it

660
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,220
means

661
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,580
that salvation

662
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,760
is by grace

663
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,100
alone

664
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,620
and you and I

665
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,060
can say

666
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,900
is it possible

667
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,700
that we may come

668
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,280
to certainty

669
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,780
this Bible

670
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,840
says that we

671
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,620
are saved

672
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,300
by grace

673
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,740
alone

674
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,900
Paul again

675
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,700
writing to the

676
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,020
feet

677
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,100
says by grace

678
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,260
are ye saved

679
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,280
and it's been

680
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,960
prepared

681
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,460
bought

682
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,120
and paid

683
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,480
for

684
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,160
untouched

685
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,760
by you

686
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,220
and me

687
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,380
already

688
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,320
waiting

689
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,520
in the blood

690
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,060
of Jesus

691
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,680
Christ

692
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,240
and that's

693
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,880
why today

694
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
446 years

695
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,060
later

696
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,220
we ought to

697
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,040
say to ourselves

698
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,900
if I can come

699
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,500
to certainty

700
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,800
if Paul says

701
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,780
be not unwise

702
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,980
don't be fools

703
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,880
and he says

704
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,780
understand what

705
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,480
the will of God

706
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
is that I can

707
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,300
come to certainty

708
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,460
that I can

709
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,160
know this

710
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,580
truth

711
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,280
as regards

712
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,660
the way

713
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,300
of salvation

714
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,460
then I ought

715
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,100
to thank

716
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,720
God

717
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,620
that God

718
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,680
has restored

719
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,940
that truth

720
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,440
true it was

721
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,940
new

722
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,180
and some say

723
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,140
because it was

724
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,900
new and different

725
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,760
when Martin Luther

726
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,540
announced it

727
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,720
because it was

728
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,320
different from

729
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,280
the accepted way

730
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
therefore it was

731
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,780
wrong

732
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,120
listen

733
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,440
it was new

734
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,500
only in the sense

735
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,940
that it was

736
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,320
different

737
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,560
it wasn't

738
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,920
new

739
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,200
it was as old

740
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,140
as the Christian

741
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,680
church

742
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,660
take the book

743
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,120
of Acts

744
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,740
and go back

745
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,480
to an account

746
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,780
there

747
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,820
of the council

748
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,440
of Jerusalem

749
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,140
that met in

750
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,760
about the year

751
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,200
50

752
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,480
this was the

753
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,200
problem that

754
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,860
came up in

755
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,220
the early

756
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,140
Christian church

757
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,440
is salvation

758
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,300
by grace

759
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,720
alone

760
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,620
is it prepared

761
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,440
by God

762
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,840
alone

763
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,620
through Christ

764
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,520
untouched

765
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,900
by human hands

766
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,780
and there was

767
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,220
a meeting

768
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,860
in Jerusalem

769
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,640
because the

770
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,380
problem was

771
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,020
vexing the

772
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,360
church

773
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,100
is that it

774
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,160
well what

775
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,540
happened

776
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,620
Peter was there

777
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,520
and Peter

778
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,340
told of his

779
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,820
experience

780
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,300
that he went

781
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,960
to Caesarea

782
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,560
remember when he

783
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,860
was called

784
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,420
to Caesarea

785
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,600
I stood in

786
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:33,980
that old

787
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,500
sea coast

788
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,860
town

789
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,160
and there

790
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,960
lived Cornelius

791
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,420
who was

792
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,880
again a

793
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,400
Gentile

794
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
a non-Jew

795
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,320
Cornelius

796
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,860
wanted to be

797
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,460
a Christian

798
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,560
and therefore

799
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
how does a

800
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,740
non-Jew

801
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,600
a Gentile

802
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,160
become a

803
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,480
Christian

804
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,020
well Jewish

805
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,460
Christians

806
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,800
thought

807
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,360
that they

808
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,840
had to be

809
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,560
circumcised

810
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:48,880
first

811
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,280
and become

812
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,720
a Jew

813
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,440
you've got

814
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,320
to circumcise

815
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,960
a Gentile

816
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,520
then you can

817
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:52,980
become a

818
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,160
Christian

819
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,560
but you see

820
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,920
what that

821
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,200
meant

822
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,220
that meant

823
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,900
that salvation

824
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,560
was not

825
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,240
by grace

826
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,680
alone

827
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,500
that it

828
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,100
had to be

829
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,420
touched

830
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,940
by human

831
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,300
hand

832
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,100
that man

833
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,660
was going

834
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,100
to add

835
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,600
something

836
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,920
well Peter

837
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,540
said when I

838
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:04,900
went to

839
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,340
Caesarea

840
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,780
and I

841
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,220
went into

842
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,780
Cornelius'

843
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,300
home

844
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,860
and he

845
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,200
wanted to

846
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,440
be a

847
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,760
Christian

848
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,160
and I

849
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,140
baptized him

850
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,940
he said the

851
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,480
Holy Spirit

852
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,580
manifested himself

853
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,200
and we talked

854
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,800
in languages

855
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,340
that we had

856
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,840
never learned

857
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,200
before

858
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,120
just as we

859
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,560
did on the

860
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,840
day of

861
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,360
Pentecost

862
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
Peter said

863
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,860
surely the

864
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,420
Holy Spirit

865
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,980
was telling

866
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,640
us this is

867
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,080
the way it

868
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,420
is

869
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
and then Paul

870
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:22,840
got up

871
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,200
and Paul

872
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,980
testified at

873
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,500
that council

874
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,760
meeting

875
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,560
and he said

876
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,940
on my

877
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,860
missionary journeys

878
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,540
when I preached

879
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,400
to Gentiles

880
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,160
he said

881
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,540
there was

882
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
the manifestation

883
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,140
of the Spirit

884
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,940
we never had

885
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,700
to circumcise

886
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,520
Gentiles

887
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,420
there was

888
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,000
nothing they

889
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,760
had to add

890
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,480
it was by

891
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,020
grace

892
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,200
and then James

893
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
the brother of the Lord

894
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,580
he got up

895
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,100
and testified

896
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,920
on the basis

897
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,820
of the word of God

898
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,520
the Old Testament

899
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,740
this is what the Bible

900
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,220
says

901
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
in the year 50

902
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,600
therefore this thing

903
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,140
was settled

904
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,700
when we talk about

905
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,640
Luther announcing

906
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,280
something new

907
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,980
sure it was new

908
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,420
in the sense

909
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,040
that it was different

910
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,360
but it was the same

911
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,020
old way

912
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,100
that goes right

913
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,260
back to Jesus Christ

914
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,060
that was settled

915
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,840
in the council

916
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,480
of Jerusalem

917
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,780
when again

918
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,540
the Holy Spirit

919
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
brought the church

920
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,100
to a unity

921
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,340
this is it

922
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,960
and we ought to

923
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,560
thank God

924
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,080
for it

925
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,140
and we ought to

926
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,640
thank God

927
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,460
that we have it

928
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
because again

929
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,600
there is that

930
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,040
certainty

931
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,100
that we can have

932
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,260
we stand here

933
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,000
446 years later

934
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,120
and we say to ourselves

935
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,460
if Luther announced

936
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,400
a new way

937
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
after all

938
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,500
if it was different

939
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,840
can we know

940
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,860
can anybody know

941
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,700
why it's within grasp

942
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,500
because again

943
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,460
we've got the scriptures

944
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,740
it's the only authority

945
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,820
that's what he used

946
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,400
the scriptures testify

947
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
that salvation

948
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,380
is by grace alone

949
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,340
in the third place

950
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,460
they testify this

951
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,100
God's scriptures

952
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,620
testify

953
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,920
that salvation

954
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,700
or the way to heaven

955
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
is by grace alone

956
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,420
through faith

957
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,320
you may say

958
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
now bring that down

959
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,920
so I can understand

960
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,800
what are you talking about

961
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,180
faith

962
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,760
well if grace means

963
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,520
this it's untouched

964
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,240
by human hand

965
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,920
if you've got that

966
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,400
it was bought

967
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,940
and paid for

968
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,860
before we were born

969
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,680
let's look at faith

970
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,560
what do you mean by that

971
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,520
by faith we simply mean this

972
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,320
that this tag

973
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,260
it's how do I get it

974
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,880
in other words

975
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,900
if grace

976
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,920
the mercy of God

977
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
has made it possible

978
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,580
and it's been ready

979
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,380
for me even before

980
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,960
I was born

981
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,820
how do I get it

982
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,740
well what does

983
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
the word of God say

984
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,700
Luther was told

985
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,480
that you get it

986
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,120
again

987
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,180
you get it by

988
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,860
earning it

989
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,040
by your life

990
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,340
and so if ever

991
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,700
a man ever tried

992
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,660
to earn

993
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,240
this gift of grace

994
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
that was prepared

995
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,060
before he was born

996
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,740
if ever a man

997
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,300
tried to earn it

998
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,780
by his life

999
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,220
he did

1000
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,260
first of all

1001
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
he became a monk

1002
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,700
and that meant

1003
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,120
that he took

1004
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,980
the vow of poverty

1005
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,820
renounced everything

1006
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,600
that he ever had

1007
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
he took the vow of chastity

1008
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
to live a clean life

1009
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,300
he took the vow of celibacy

1010
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,220
that he wouldn't marry

1011
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,960
he went into the monastery

1012
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,520
again

1013
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,440
he beat himself

1014
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
he mortified the flesh

1015
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,680
he did everything

1016
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,280
that he could

1017
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,320
he starved himself

1018
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,360
he beat his back

1019
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
that the blood would run

1020
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,340
and all cried out

1021
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,480
but it never satisfied

1022
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,300
oh Lord

1023
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,380
when have I done enough

1024
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,840
you see

1025
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,000
he was trying

1026
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,260
because he had been told

1027
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,520
that you get this gift

1028
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,240
by again earning it

1029
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,340
you get it by your life

1030
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,080
but isn't it marvelous

1031
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,940
that when he turned

1032
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,900
to the word of God

1033
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,100
and he saw Paul

1034
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,120
writing to the Ephesians

1035
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,520
and all said

1036
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,220
by grace are ye saved

1037
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,000
through faith

1038
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
that means

1039
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,020
not by your life

1040
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,380
isn't it marvelous

1041
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,460
that it isn't by life

1042
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,220
Luther was trying

1043
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,920
by his life

1044
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,640
but he was haunted

1045
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,260
by this

1046
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,160
that he knew

1047
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,400
that he thought evil thoughts

1048
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,220
he spoke things

1049
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,160
that he shouldn't say

1050
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,320
he had done things

1051
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,180
that he shouldn't have done

1052
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,200
he had left undone

1053
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,760
many a thing

1054
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
that he should have done

1055
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,760
and he cried out

1056
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,020
and he said

1057
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,680
how can I by my life

1058
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,780
ever buy

1059
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,620
this gift

1060
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,580
of eternal life

1061
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,980
and everlasting salvation

1062
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,600
and then he read

1063
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,460
in the word of God

1064
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,400
that the just lives

1065
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
by faith

1066
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,800
or justification

1067
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
by faith

1068
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,120
that justified man

1069
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,080
is a forgiven man

1070
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
to be justified

1071
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,060
means again

1072
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,720
to be saved

1073
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,780
it means to have God

1074
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,960
declare you without sin

1075
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,920
by faith

1076
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
faith therefore

1077
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,740
means it's not

1078
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,780
on the basis of life

1079
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,360
it means that this gift

1080
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,480
becomes yours and mine

1081
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,740
on the base of faith

1082
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,840
which means to trust

1083
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,560
it means to just

1084
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,720
humbly trust

1085
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,240
Jesus

1086
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,460
as your personal

1087
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,600
Lord and Savior

1088
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,300
and that's what

1089
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,640
Martin Luther found

1090
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,900
and oh what a joy

1091
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
that he a sinner

1092
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,540
could have this salvation

1093
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,260
that was bought

1094
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,840
and paid for

1095
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,520
in the blood of Christ

1096
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,640
before he was ever born

1097
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,840
that it was given

1098
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,540
to any man

1099
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,880
who would just trust Jesus

1100
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,180
that would mean

1101
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,480
for a man to stand

1102
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,940
and to say

1103
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm a lost sinner

1104
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,420
but I put my faith

1105
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,080
and my trust

1106
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,640
and my hope

1107
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,180
of salvation

1108
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,120
in you Lord Jesus

1109
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
that in your righteousness

1110
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,540
that you merited

1111
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,320
on the cross

1112
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,380
that you will give me

1113
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,240
that in exchange

1114
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,840
for believing

1115
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,720
and therefore I am saved

1116
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,860
and that's what he found

1117
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,240
and again

1118
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,520
when a man through faith

1119
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
puts his trust in Christ

1120
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,260
he always commits his life

1121
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,560
he gives his life

1122
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,980
not that his life saves him

1123
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,700
but he gives it

1124
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,000
in honor of Jesus

1125
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,820
and he gives it

1126
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,340
as a sense of gratitude

1127
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,060
because he has been saved

1128
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,980
certainly the life

1129
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,800
goes along

1130
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,340
but again

1131
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,540
salvation is

1132
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,820
by believing

1133
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,980
what does that mean

1134
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,940
today in your life

1135
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,360
and mine

1136
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,520
today 446 years later

1137
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
doesn't it mean this

1138
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,460
that when we say

1139
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,200
I want to know

1140
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,420
the unvarnished truth

1141
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,620
what is the way to heaven

1142
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,200
and the word of God

1143
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,700
is here

1144
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,640
and it's by grace

1145
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,600
through faith

1146
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,640
by trusting

1147
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,520
doesn't it mean

1148
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,540
that we've got the answer

1149
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
to hopelessness

1150
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,720
is there any reason

1151
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,360
for any man ever

1152
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,020
to be hopeless

1153
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,240
although hopeless

1154
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,740
is the world

1155
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,900
here's Winston Churchill's

1156
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,160
daughter

1157
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,040
commits suicide

1158
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,480
you wonder

1159
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,400
what's so hopeless

1160
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,920
in life

1161
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,120
we think of Judas

1162
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,080
taking his own life

1163
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,180
what's so hopeless

1164
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,140
what is this thing

1165
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,260
but again

1166
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,380
when we understand

1167
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,220
that the way

1168
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,480
is not by our life

1169
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,360
but it is

1170
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,440
by trusting in Jesus

1171
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,620
think what that means

1172
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,300
that means

1173
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,720
there is no hopelessness

1174
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,680
you and I

1175
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,540
can't sin

1176
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,260
so greatly

1177
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
but what again

1178
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,400
if we trust Jesus

1179
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
there is eternal life

1180
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,440
I don't care

1181
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,400
what we have done

1182
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,340
it matters not

1183
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,020
what sins

1184
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,680
have been charged

1185
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,460
against us

1186
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,580
it matters not

1187
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,160
how far

1188
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,120
we have gone away

1189
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,340
there is only

1190
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,540
one sin

1191
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,000
that can condemn us

1192
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,120
and that sin

1193
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,080
is refusing

1194
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,140
to trust Jesus

1195
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,860
that's all

1196
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,780
the unpardonable sin

1197
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,260
is nothing

1198
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,840
but the sin

1199
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,140
that says

1200
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,780
I don't want

1201
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,400
to be saved

1202
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,960
I don't want

1203
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,940
to trust you Jesus

1204
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,180
I don't care

1205
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,020
what you have done

1206
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,060
or what I have done

1207
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,300
it's never hopeless

1208
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,320
the only thing

1209
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,120
that can prevent

1210
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,880
your salvation

1211
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,520
and mine

1212
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,320
is by refusing

1213
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,040
to put our trust

1214
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,940
in Christ

1215
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,260
as our personal Lord

1216
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,860
that's what

1217
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,680
Luther announced

1218
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,620
it wasn't new

1219
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,360
God knows

1220
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,320
it wasn't new

1221
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
it was the gospel

1222
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,040
it was the good news

1223
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,140
it was hope

1224
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,580
for the world

1225
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,200
no wonder

1226
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,120
it shook the world

1227
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,380
to its very foundations

1228
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,880
oh I stood

1229
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,740
in Worms Germany

1230
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,340
we were there

1231
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,400
one warm day

1232
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,180
in July

1233
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,500
we were the only

1234
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
two my wife and I

1235
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,280
and we had a guide

1236
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,220
with us all day

1237
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,600
a young lady

1238
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,300
a Lutheran

1239
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,180
who knew the history

1240
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,380
and I stood

1241
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,920
in Worms

1242
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,460
at the place

1243
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,380
where Luther had stood

1244
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,520
when he gave a defense

1245
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,620
of that new way

1246
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,240
of salvation

1247
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,120
which wasn't new

1248
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,660
at all

1249
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,840
and then again

1250
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,700
into the Lutheran church

1251
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,720
the Luther Kirche

1252
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,600
there in Germany

1253
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,480
and Worms

1254
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,080
and went in

1255
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,940
and emblazoned

1256
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,980
on the walls

1257
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,340
are the three articles

1258
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,680
of the Apostles' Creed

1259
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,240
and the matchless explanations

1260
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,340
that Luther has written

1261
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,900
remember you memorized them

1262
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,280
remember especially

1263
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,120
the explanation

1264
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,100
of the second article

1265
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,900
and it's written there

1266
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,860
in the church in German

1267
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,080
I believe that Jesus Christ

1268
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,740
true God

1269
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
begotten of the Father

1270
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,460
from eternity

1271
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,040
and also true man

1272
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,980
born of the Virgin Mary

1273
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,780
is my Lord

1274
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,120
who has redeemed me

1275
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,500
a lost and condemned creature

1276
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,580
purchased and won me

1277
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,380
from all sin

1278
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,200
from death

1279
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
and from the power

1280
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,460
of the devil

1281
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,760
not with gold or silver

1282
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,700
but with his holy precious blood

1283
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,500
and with his innocence

1284
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,620
suffering and death

1285
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,120
that I may be his own

1286
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,840
and live under him

1287
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,480
in his kingdom

1288
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
and serve him

1289
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
in everlasting righteousness

1290
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,240
innocence and blessedness

1291
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,560
even as he is risen

1292
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,160
from the dead

1293
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,140
lives and reigns

1294
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,020
to all eternity

1295
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,960
this is most certainly true

1296
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,940
do you remember it

1297
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,460
written emblazoned

1298
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,740
on the walls of the church

1299
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,440
and then there was

1300
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
the Luther Platz

1301
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,940
again the Luther Park

1302
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,960
where Luther stands

1303
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,860
a large monument

1304
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,720
with the reformers

1305
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,980
with a bible in his hand

1306
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,640
with the words inscribed

1307
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:45,960
here

1308
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,420
stay

1309
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,700
here

1310
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,420
here

1311
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
here

1312
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,420
here

1313
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,060
I stand

1314
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,880
I cannot do otherwise

1315
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
God

1316
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,880
help me

1317
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,260
what does it mean

1318
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,880
to you and me

1319
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,100
listen

1320
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,140
it means this

1321
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,920
it means that

1322
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,680
salvation

1323
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,400
is open

1324
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,000
bought

1325
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,220
and paid for

1326
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,780
and ready

1327
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,540
for you

1328
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,140
and me

1329
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,500
right now

1330
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,880
not five minutes

1331
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,720
from now

1332
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,240
right now

1333
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,040
this is the moment

1334
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,160
in your life

1335
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,700
and mine

1336
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,860
I don't care who you are

1337
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,720
I don't care if you've been

1338
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,360
guilty of murder

1339
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't care if you've murdered

1340
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,340
ten unborn children

1341
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,760
I don't care what adultery

1342
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,820
has beset you

1343
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,340
I don't care how many things

1344
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,780
you've done

1345
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,020
that you can't undo

1346
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,260
I don't care how many things

1347
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,780
stand

1348
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,660
and they stand

1349
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,540
just history

1350
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,820
and they haunt you

1351
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,180
but I know this

1352
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,940
just as certainly

1353
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,980
there's a God in heaven

1354
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,160
in this moment

1355
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,140
right now

1356
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,800
there is life

1357
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,600
and salvation

1358
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,540
for you

1359
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,140
because it's by grace

1360
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,960
it's been bought

1361
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,860
and paid for

1362
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,360
Jesus bore hell

1363
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,680
for all of those things

1364
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,700
before you were born

1365
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
and he says

1366
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,080
if you trust me

1367
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,000
right now

1368
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,820
if you can turn

1369
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,320
and say to him

1370
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,420
I'm a sinner

1371
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,800
but I trust you

1372
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,700
right now

1373
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,020
oh you don't have

1374
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,200
to make up anything

1375
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,840
tomorrow

1376
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,240
and you can do that later

1377
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,380
but right now

1378
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,660
this is the moment

1379
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,560
in your life

1380
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,960
pass me not

1381
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,180
oh gentle Savior

1382
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,760
hear my humble cry

1383
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,380
while on others

1384
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,400
thou art calling

1385
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,060
do not pass me by

1386
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,420
Savior

1387
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,180
Savior

1388
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,000
hear my humble cry

1389
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,740
while on others

1390
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,200
thou art calling

1391
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,380
do not pass me by

1392
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,700
can you say that

1393
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,400
you can say it

1394
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,120
in your pew

1395
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,600
or where I'm standing here

1396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,480
wherever you are

1397
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,160
on the radio

1398
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,360
you can say

1399
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,200
don't pass me by

1400
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,100
I trust you

1401
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,960
as my Lord

1402
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,580
you can stand

1403
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,700
right now

1404
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,320
saved

1405
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,460
forgiven

1406
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,640
one of God's children

1407
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,880
that's what the

1408
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,280
reformation meant

1409
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,020
and when Martin Luther

1410
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,320
was ready to die

1411
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,100
that's what his

1412
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,040
faith and his

1413
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,120
trust were

1414
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,980
it was peace

1415
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,920
because he had

1416
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,060
announced a new

1417
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,540
way

1418
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,140
but it wasn't

1419
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,160
new at all

1420
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,340
it was the

1421
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,620
same old way

1422
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,020
that God

1423
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,720
had revealed

1424
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,560
in the scriptures

1425
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,820
may God grant

1426
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,340
you and me

1427
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,200
in this moment

1428
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,800
peace in Jesus Christ

1429
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,120
amen

1430
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,040
the peace of God

1431
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,240
which passeth all

1432
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
human understanding

1433
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,980
keep and unites

1434
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,060
your hearts and minds

1435
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,140
in Christ Jesus

1436
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,040
unto life everlasting

1437
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,560
him

1438
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,560
you

1439
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,960
you

1440
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,840
you

1441
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,540
you

1442
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,800
you

1443
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:14,820
For God so loved the world

1444
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
that he gave his only begotten Son

1445
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,380
that whosoever believeth in him

1446
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,440
should not perish

1447
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,840
but have everlasting life.
