1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
grace be unto you and peace from god our father ran from the lord jesus christ amen let us hear

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,520
the word of god our regular epistolary lesson for this sunday as we find a written in paul's

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:24,440
letter to the philippians in the third chapter especially the 20th verse for our citizenship

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:32,180
is in heaven and now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,620
be acceptable in thy sight oh lord our strength and our redeemer amen

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:48,480
in christ jesus our lord and savior dear friends you who are here in god's house this morning

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,880
and you also christian fans who are worshiping with us by means of the radio last sunday you

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,340
recall our text was taken from paul's letter to the philippians and today it is also taken from that

9
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,400
same letter it was while paul was on his second missionary journey you remember that he went over

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,220
into macedonia up into the city of philippi and there to establish the first christian congregation

11
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,340
on the continent of europe paul always loved that congregation dearly so that years later when he

12
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,300
was a prisoner in rome he wrote a letter to that congregation and we know it as the letter to the

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,860
philippian congregation and in our text this morning paul is telling the philippian christians

14
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:39,020
what their high position is as christians he is telling them what an exalted position is theirs

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,980
because they are children of god what a high enviable position it is and then he tells them just what

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,540
that position that status is since they are christians he said our citizenship is in heaven

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,860
in other words he says philippian christians because you are christians this is your high position you are

18
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:11,140
no less than citizens of heaven you are not citizens of earth you are not citizens of this world you are

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,640
no less than citizens of the heavenly country and the saint paul speaks to you and me this morning through

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,840
the word of god reminding us that as christians this is our high status it is our incomparable position

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:33,420
that we are no less than citizens of heaven citizens of the heavenly kingdom not citizens of the earth

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,000
and sometimes i suppose in your life and mine it's true a statements like that leave us cold do they not

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,980
we say to ourselves all right so i am a citizen of heaven i am not a citizen of earth what about it

24
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,540
is that such an exalted position after all and in your life and mine there are times are there not when

25
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,640
we say to ourselves well i don't know whether that is such an exalted enviable incomparable position

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,740
that i am a citizen of heaven we may say sometimes it seems like citizens of the earth citizens of this

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,400
world have the odds in their favor they have the advantages they seem to have the blessings

28
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,300
we do not seem to have the blessings and the advantages that citizens of this earth have

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,740
and then we begin to wonder do we not you know today is the second last sunday of the present church

30
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,580
year next sunday brings this church year to an end for we remember that the calendar year of course

31
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,460
begins on january the first but the church year does not begin at that time it begins the first sunday

32
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,620
in advent which happens to be the first sunday in december this year the church year ends next sunday

33
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,680
and as we think about the lengthening of days and as we think about our departure from this world

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,960
it is well that this morning we take a look at our position at our status and if this is such a mighty

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,040
position such a high calling that we are no less than citizens of heaven and not citizens of earth we

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,960
ought to look at it to see whether the odds the blessings the advantages are not on our side not

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,340
on the side of citizens of this world or of this earth on the basis of the word of god paul when he

38
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,620
wrote to the philippians he was filled with this joy we are no less he says but then citizens of heaven

39
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,080
we are not citizens of the earth and the advantages are ours if we just stop the thing for a moment

40
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,580
because in the first place let's know this being citizens of heaven because we are christians

41
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:45,540
that means this it means that we are friends of the cross of christ we are on the contrary not

42
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:54,680
enemies of the cross of christ as our citizens of this earth paul aptly describes what he means by

43
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,780
citizens of the earth or of this world he says there are many that walk and he told the philippians and

44
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,940
i've mentioned this to you before and he says now i mention it to you again with tears that he says

45
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:13,480
they are the enemies of the cross of christ who is a citizen of this world not a citizen of heaven

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,480
any man who is an enemy of the cross of christ you know those are words that you've got to look at

47
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,640
twice you notice paul does not say by inspiration they are enemies of christ he says they are enemies of

48
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,020
the cross of christ there's a tremendous difference many a citizen of this earth of this world who is

49
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,400
not a citizen of heaven is not an enemy of christ oh many a citizen of this earth loves him he will

50
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,040
tell you that christ is the greatest teacher that ever lived he will point you to the sermon on the

51
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,860
mountain say isn't it wonderful look what he taught and then many a citizen of this earth will point to

52
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,420
christ and say what a marvelous example there is no greater example in all the world than christ and

53
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:04,260
they will thrill to him and say if you walk in the way which he gave as a pattern then that's all you

54
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:14,180
need they love him as a teacher and they love him as an example but they are enemies of the cross of

55
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:23,400
christ there is something about the cross that the citizen of this earth doesn't like he has no room

56
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:32,500
in his life for the cross why you say the cross of jesus means his death and therefore the man of the

57
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,080
world says as far as i'm concerned he didn't have to die on the cross all that you need is to have him

58
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,800
as a teacher and all that you need is to have him as an example and then follow him live like he lived

59
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,600
be good to your neighbor live a clean decent life a good moral life be honest be above reproach and

60
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,240
that's all you need for salvation you see he looks at the cross and he says that's slaughterhouse religion

61
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:07,400
that's the blood i do not want the blood but you see paul says he is an enemy of the cross of christ

62
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:16,840
why because look at jesus he did not come into this world to be primarily a teacher jesus christ didn't

63
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,760
come into this world to be primarily an example in which you and i are to follow him and walk he came

64
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:33,480
primarily and foremost to die and when a man looks at jesus and he denies the very reason why he came

65
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:44,520
he takes unto himself something that is secondary jesus christ came for the cross why because he knew

66
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,080
that who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one he knew that you and i if we follow him by

67
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,800
an example cannot save ourselves he knew that you and i could never be perfect that he is a perfect

68
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,160
example we can never attain to perfection and so that's why he god's son came out of the ivory palaces

69
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,520
and went to the cross to die because in that death he knew that he would have to atone for our guilt and

70
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:20,760
for our punishment that in his death and in his death alone salvation might be possible for the human race

71
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,400
a man who is a citizen of this earth is a man that may love christ but he's an enemy of the cross and

72
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:36,760
therefore we say where is there any advantage a child of god who is a citizen of heaven he is a friend of

73
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,840
the cross of christ because that's the center of what he believes it is the cross because he stands at

74
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,440
the foot of calvary and he confesses his sins and he knows that within himself there dwelleth no good

75
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,400
thing and he knows that only by the shed blood of jesus christ is there forgiveness life and salvation

76
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,240
and therefore when we are citizens of heaven listen the advantage is on our side the blessing is on our

77
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,440
side because ours is the advantage at the end of life of heaven and the man who is a citizen of this earth

78
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,720
his is hell there is a tremendous difference is there not without the cross

79
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,640
without jesus christ that died friend if all you can see in him that he was only a teacher

80
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,160
and that he was only example you are an enemy of the cross of christ and you are denying that which

81
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:40,360
is vital and that which is necessary and no man shall see heaven on the basis of following jesus as an

82
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:49,160
example it's the cross that stands paramount and that stands center in christian theology and that

83
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,200
must stand as a friend in your life and mine is there any difference between heaven and hell when jesus

84
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,920
talked about judas who lost his salvation he said it were better for that man that he had never been

85
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,800
born then he said one day for what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul

86
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,960
if you had the whole world and you lost your soul and you lost the citizenship of heaven

87
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,600
jesus says you're the loser because there are no compensations

88
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,760
that's the loss for which nothing can make up for it it were better that you and i had never been born

89
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,520
it's strange isn't it in our lives when we are reminded we are citizens of heaven not this earth but

90
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,760
sometimes we still feel that the advantages the blessings again the real privileges the odds are all

91
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,440
on the side of the other person but there is a difference the difference is heaven with god eternally

92
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,760
or hell paul says again their end is destruction their end is perdition perdition again satan is the son

93
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:08,040
of perdition and eternity separated from the very presence of god's grace and god's mercy the advantages

94
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:17,880
the blessings are on our side what a noble position what an enabling place what an enviable stand and

95
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,240
status is ours we are citizens of heaven not of this earth and if this morning on the second last

96
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,000
sunday of the year is the day's length and we think about the end of time if you and i could take that

97
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,440
truth and write it onto our hearts never to forget it that this that we are citizens of heaven not of

98
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:44,280
this earth then we would watch into our life that no man under any circumstances will ever take away

99
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,400
from you and me the christ of the cross oh and all of the ecumenical movements that are going on and

100
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,360
they're fine bear this in mind there is one central truth that we dare not lose and that is the christ

101
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:08,200
that died when you take calvary away from jesus you've got nothing left he is vital on my trip recently when i

102
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,920
was in europe i was in geneva switzerland and we passed the place of the united nations assembly which

103
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,320
was in session and then we rode along and we came to a place of a rock and there was a plaque on the rock

104
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,440
that said this place marks the workplace where woodrow wilson's league of nations had its beginning

105
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,920
and they were they held their meetings in geneva switzerland and when you think that in world war

106
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,440
one eight million five hundred thousand young men of the nations of the world lost their lives in

107
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,600
world war one and our great president woodrow wilson said this shall not happen again and there was the

108
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,200
league of nations with his famous 14 points but woodrow wilson found out to his sorrow that the 14

109
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:05,480
points of the league of nations that the 13 000 minute points of international law could not prevent

110
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:15,640
another war and he himself wrote that if civilization is to stand man must be redeemed spiritually that's it

111
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,360
and when man is redeemed spiritually don't forget he is redeemed by the precious blood of jesus christ

112
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:32,440
there is no other way don't let it slip through your fingers and mine we have an exalted position

113
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,360
we are citizens of no less than heaven of the heavenly country not of this earth well that means that we

114
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,640
are friends of the cross of jesus christ if you can emblazon it on your soul and mind this morning that we'll

115
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:57,160
never forget that don't let anybody under any circumstances take from you and me the christ of

116
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:05,480
the cross paul put it this way i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god and

117
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,960
to salvation to everyone that believes when he wrote to the philippians paul was reminding him look at our

118
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,520
exalted position he said philippians as christians this is your position this is your exalted place

119
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,720
this is your great status you are citizens of no less than heaven itself not citizens of earth

120
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,640
and therefore the advantages and the blessings and the odds are all on our side even though at times we

121
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,480
may wonder about them because in the second place let's know this that being citizens of heaven

122
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:46,760
means this that god is our god in contrast to those who are citizens of this earth whose god is their

123
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:55,240
belly paul says whose god is their belly who glory in their shame who mind earthly things what's he

124
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,520
talking about the man of the world the man who is not a citizen of heaven he has a god but it's not god

125
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:11,960
it is again his own belly or his own stomach or his own cravings within he has one aim in life and that

126
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,960
is to get all that he can of the material things of life because to him life consists only in the

127
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,000
abundance of the things which a man has and therefore you've got to get and you've got to have

128
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,800
if you are going to be happy he knows no god but his own cravings and he craves and he craves and he

129
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:43,160
goes on because he spends and absorbs all of his time in the things of this life because the man that is

130
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,080
a citizen of this earth is thoroughly convinced that the only joy and happiness that he shall find

131
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:57,640
will be in the material things of life how about citizens of heaven citizens of heaven have as their

132
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:07,480
god god himself and when you and i as christians have as our god god and not the cravings of our own

133
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:15,560
hearts for the material things of life then we allow god to remind us of the fact that we are not citizens of

134
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:23,000
this earth because we are transients we are pilgrims we're just passing through we're tourists we have

135
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,880
no abiding city here and god writes it on your soul and mine that we are just strangers and pilgrims and

136
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:40,840
therefore god warns you and me not to wrap ourselves too tightly around the things of this life because we

137
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:50,280
aren't going to be here very long we're just passing through we are only tourists we are not citizens

138
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,160
of the earth and when god almighty warns you and me that we are not to become so completely absorbed

139
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,600
into our life that these things shall overshadow him and that these things will dim god into our life and

140
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:13,720
blind us then we have this advantage the advantage of being citizens of heaven that we have peace with

141
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,080
god whether god blesses us with a lot of material things with very little and the man who is a citizen

142
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:30,200
of this life has no peace within even though he should own the world the man that lives as a citizen of

143
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:38,040
this life soon finds out that there is only a passing satisfaction in the material things of life

144
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,080
as soon as something is acquired the craving starts all over again with something more

145
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:50,440
and the man craves and he craves and then comes fear fear of losing what he's got and so he lives there

146
00:17:50,440 --> 00:18:01,240
is no peace of mind because god made you and me that conscience that part within you and me that is the moral

147
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,520
stamina and the moral quality and that voice of god within us can never be satisfied by the material things

148
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:18,200
but when again our god is the true god and not our belly then we know this that god in pointing us to him

149
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:28,440
having him and jesus christ we have peace with god everything is all right we are saved it matters not

150
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,640
then whether god blesses us with abundance or not many a trial of god has been blessed with abundance

151
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,040
abraham was an extremely wealthy man isaac and jacob were extremely wealthy people david and solomon were

152
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,520
extremely wealthy joseph of arimathea was an extremely wealthy man nicodemus was a wealthy man

153
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,560
but again they knew that they were citizens of heaven and never were these things allowed to blot out god

154
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:04,840
the advantages are on our side because citizens of heaven have peace within and when there is

155
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,360
restlessness within which means that there is a soul without god in jesus christ

156
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:19,720
there is no peace there is no peace there is no happiness there is no contentment on this second last

157
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,800
sunday of the church year oh that god would write it on your soul and on mine that we are citizens of

158
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,560
heaven not citizens of this earth just pilgrims if we would write it there never to forget it then whenever

159
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:44,120
adversity comes in your life and mine we will gladly accept it and we will stop feeling sorry for ourselves

160
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:57,640
and becoming despondent why does god send adversity in your life and mine sparing none of us john milton put

161
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:08,280
it this way he said sweet are the uses of adversity which like a toad ugly and venomous hath yet a jewel beneath

162
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:18,840
her crown have you ever asked why does god send adversity in your life and mine we who are citizens of heaven

163
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:28,040
do you want to know one reason because god knows how weak you are and how weak i am and how easy it is

164
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:35,480
to become so absorbed in the things of this life i mean honestly i do not mean being crooked

165
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:42,680
i mean getting these things in an honest and an upright way but god knows that you and i can get so

166
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:50,520
absorbed in these things that somehow or other they choke out god and they blind god to us

167
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,160
then god because he loves you and me knows something's got to be done he isn't going to give

168
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:05,800
you and me up that easily and then he sends adversity why because god knows if there is anything

169
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,920
that will make you and me stop if we're getting too absorbed in these earthly things and say wait a

170
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:24,920
minute wait a minute i am so absorbed i am forgetting god but adversity will do it i talked to a man when he

171
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,480
was offered a job twenty five thousand dollars a year what a salary and what an increase for him and as we

172
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:41,800
spoke he said to me don't worry about that money he said you see god took my son when he took my son i

173
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,600
know i'm not going to wrap myself around the things of life why was it that one of you said when you had

174
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,680
your new home all built that you were afraid to move into it because you thought something might happen

175
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:03,160
isn't it strange if in your life and mine we are prone to be so absorbed in a good way with decent

176
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:12,760
material things that we might blind god out of our life that then adversity comes and we say wait a

177
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:21,240
minute god something's wrong that's when we ought to thank god and say thanks god that you've taught me

178
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,680
that i am a stranger and a pilgrim here and that i'm not a citizen of this earth but what do we do

179
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:36,200
sometimes we get the blues and we start feeling sorry for ourselves and we start down the road of

180
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:45,880
despondency what is despondency listen despondency means this that i'm a bit irked and put out at god

181
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,200
and i say god you oughtn't to treat me that way god that isn't right i'm hurt and therefore we get

182
00:22:52,200 --> 00:23:00,120
the blues and we get depressed and we think god's got something against us when the very opposite is

183
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,240
true god's trying to get you and me to put him back where he belongs then we start down that horrible

184
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:14,360
tragic road of despondency i'm mentioning this because i've got it on my heart

185
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:23,720
not less than three people this last week have been to see me because they were despondent and

186
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,760
talking about taking their life and one of them said to me what's the difference

187
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:41,400
if i take my life i only hurt myself don't i what's the difference now we're talking about all of us

188
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,280
on this side of the jordan you who are alive and i'm alive what about this thing when i get depressed

189
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:57,240
and i get despondent because i'm a bit put out at god do i have the right to take my life because i

190
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:05,080
am going to hurt only myself do you know of any place in the word of god where because i'm feeling

191
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,920
sorry for myself that i've got a right to take my life you know of any place like that do you know

192
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:18,440
that any place where that would excuse it that doesn't excuse it does it the big thing is we may

193
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:25,880
say no man in his right mind would take his life god judges that not i and i would never step in where

194
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,560
god belongs but listen if you are deliberately planning right now is the time to do some thinking

195
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:41,160
over 200 000 in our country every year attempted over 30 000 completed may i ask you right now from

196
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,320
the bottom of my heart to yours do you know what you're doing right now are you accountable for your

197
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,320
life if you're on the road to despondency answer me do you know you're on the road

198
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,720
are you accountable do you know right from wrong right now oh not when the deed is done but where

199
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,760
are you now did you have sense enough to come to church or not to come to church are you have sense

200
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,840
enough now to listen or not listen do you know what you're doing do you have a knowledge of right

201
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,640
along listen to take one's life as a deliberate act and therefore it depends on this am i accountable

202
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:26,440
when i deliberately plan to take my life a man only hurts himself is that right why there's something

203
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,280
about taking my life that is different than if i take the life of somebody else if i took your life

204
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,280
there would still be time that i could repent that i could get right with god but you see when i take my

205
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:46,920
own life deliberately when i plan to do it just because i'm on the road that's despondency and i take

206
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:54,920
my own life don't you realize that then you and i stand before almighty god in death with our blood on

207
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:04,760
our own soul and there isn't any time for repentance when death takes place the word of god knows no place

208
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,640
after death for repentance you may say to me well can i repent ahead of time well listen the very

209
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,880
essence of repentance is this that if i'm sorry i won't do it you can't do it ahead of time that's

210
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,320
the tragedy i'm talking to you and to myself on this side of the jordan god's that judge when these

211
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:32,760
things take place not you and i doesn't a man hurt only himself but oh god what you and i can do to

212
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:41,960
ourselves write it on your soul this morning will you when you start walking down that damnable

213
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:53,240
horrible dark road of despondency for god's sake don't think that it's pleasing god say to yourself

214
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:01,960
god god i'm sorry that i'm irked at you and for god's sake turn around and come back and talk to yourself

215
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,680
could i say it any clearer i had to say it it's all in my heart there's too many of you

216
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:19,560
who are talking about this thing you don't want to live because you're feeling sorry for yourself

217
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:28,600
i'm at your service i'm at your service 24 hours out of the day you and i are citizens of heaven

218
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:39,080
don't walk that road don't go down that road and let somebody take the heavenly citizenship away

219
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:47,000
because we are despondent it's a bad road stay off don't ever get on it never

220
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,240
when paul wrote to the philippians he was writing with a thrill in his heart and he was reminding them

221
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,640
this is your high calling we are citizens of heaven think of it no less than citizens of heaven

222
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,840
not citizens of earth we're only pilgrims here and some of them wondered and began as you and i

223
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,920
wonder we said the obs the advances the blessings all seem on the other side but they aren't because

224
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:17,400
listen being citizens of heaven as christian means this that we are awaiting the return of jesus christ

225
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,120
paul put it this way he said our citizenship is in heaven from whence we look for the savior the

226
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,240
lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body

227
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,760
according to the working whereby he is able even should do all things unto himself

228
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,400
isn't that marvelous paul said listen we as christians we wait for his return the man of the world

229
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,000
the citizen of the earth isn't waiting for christ to come again he doesn't believe he's coming

230
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,240
but you and i know that before he died he said he died and he said after i die i will rise again he

231
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,720
arose and we know that he went up the slope of the mount of olives one day and i walked it and i was

232
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,200
there where again he blessed the eleven and he went to heaven the angel said he's coming back remember

233
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,120
that oh he's coming back he conquered the grave what's going to keep him from coming back he is coming

234
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,200
back and then when he comes back what is our advantage but when he comes he has told us this that our

235
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,640
bodies can go down in the graves and he will raise them up and we will put on a glorified body a body

236
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:19,880
like the son of god has no longer touched by sickness and disease and those who are only citizens of this

237
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,800
world will put on a corruptible body which will be a body for damnation there is a tremendous advantage

238
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,640
on our side when we stop to think and on this second last sunday of the church here when the

239
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,000
shadows begin to lengthen we begin to think about the end of time what we not then if we write it on

240
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,400
our souls god don't ever let me forget it i'm a citizen of heaven i'm only a stranger i'm only a

241
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,880
tourist i'm only a pilgrim i'm only passing through here i don't belong here and therefore don't let me

242
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:56,600
get so absorbed in the things of this life god that i block you out of my life oh then we ought

243
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,840
to be examples to one another and to encourage one another when sickness comes ought we not

244
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,320
what ought we to do as christians oh death's going to look for a cause isn't it you are going to die and

245
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,120
so am i and death's going to find some reason to choose me sickness and that sickness can take

246
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,960
multitudinous forms all the time may come in your body mind will start to slowly waste away and everybody can see it

247
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,800
but oh we can follow the example of paul can't we and we can go to one another and say all these

248
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,240
bodies of ours they can become so contaminated with sin and they can go down and oh they can be so

249
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,040
destroyed with all kinds of vermin and all kinds of diseases but oh when christ comes again we can say

250
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,560
but we're going to put on a new body it's going to be a changed body it's going to be a glorious glorified

251
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,800
body never again showing the signs of sickness and disease and then when we can encourage one

252
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,320
another doesn't it mean this that as the shadows lengthen if sickness has come to us especially

253
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,960
incurable illness we can thank god for it because you know god has a purpose in that that's the way

254
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,120
god makes us homesick doesn't he you know we can even be a tourist and we get so absorbed in the things

255
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,520
of life that we sometimes forget that we're citizens of heaven and we're going there and we

256
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:19,480
wonder well how will god get us to want to go and he sends sickness doesn't he then we get homesick

257
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,520
well there was abraham he left her of the chaldees remember and he came on over to the land of came

258
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,680
into a strange land and again through all the things of life and the trials that he had he became homesick

259
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,960
and we read about abraham and we are told that abraham he looked for a city which had foundations

260
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:44,120
the real eternal city whose builder and maker is god he got homesick he wanted to go home and when

261
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:51,160
sickness comes to your body and mine and we know that it's incurable something precious starts doesn't

262
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:59,000
we we get homesick we get along for the homeland we get along so the fulfillment of our citizenship

263
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,720
i had a birthday last week and of course i missed the card that i usually got from my sister and when

264
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:13,960
i thought of her again it always came a day late always late with a card or a birthday card but i saw her

265
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:24,360
body waste away just wasting away and draining away and i saw a heavenly homesickness there longing to go

266
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:33,240
home longing to be with her lord and you know this thing of sickness it's god's way of telling you and

267
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:42,280
me child i'm getting a bit homesick for you we waited in heaven a long time and now i've sent sickness

268
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:50,920
and soon i'll be calling for you we're anxiously awaiting your coming we're a bit homesick for you

269
00:32:50,920 --> 00:33:01,960
the mansions are ready it's about time to come home well that's the advantage of being a citizen of

270
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:09,480
heaven isn't it well we can walk the glory road and when the illness takes our bodies we can look up

271
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,800
and say that i'm the citizen of heaven the homeland oh the homeland the land of souls free born

272
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:26,920
no gloomy night is known there but a the paid this morn i'm sighing for that country my heart is aching

273
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:39,880
oh to be at home in the homeland to be there with our christ that's the fulfillment of a homesickness

274
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:47,480
god grant that this morning you will write on your soul and i will write it on mine

275
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
