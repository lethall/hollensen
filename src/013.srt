1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,560
Let us hear the Word of God as we find it written in the Gospel according to St. Luke,

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,900
reading there in the first chapter from the 67th to the 79th verse as follows.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,060
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied, saying,

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,620
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,420
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,460
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began,

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,260
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us,

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,880
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,080
the oath which he swore to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us,

11
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,420
that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,560
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,100
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the highest,

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,040
for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,640
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,920
through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,200
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,940
to guide our feet into the way of peace.

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:49,180
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,880
O Lord, our strength and our redeemer. Amen.

21
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,560
In Christ Jesus, our great Advent King, dear friends,

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,940
you who are here in God's house this morning,

23
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,840
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us this day by means of the radio.

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,220
Today is the first Sunday in Advent.

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,760
It also is the day that ushers in a new church year.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,740
Now the word Advent means the coming,

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,920
and it refers to Jesus as the coming one,

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,420
the one who is going to come again.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,440
The Advent season includes the four Sundays before Christmas,

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:40,200
and it has as its purpose to get us ready for a proper celebration of the birthday of Jesus.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,480
And this morning, on this first Sunday in Advent,

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,280
as we look forward to the birth of Jesus Christ,

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,500
we would get ourselves ready by asking Zacharias,

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,860
a priest of God, the father of John the Baptist,

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,140
just who this Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem, really was.

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,760
The occasion for the expression from Zacharias

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,140
was the time when John was just eight days old.

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,360
It was the time when the family and friends gathered together

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,260
to circumcise the child, giving him the sign of the covenant,

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
and to give him a name.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,960
Now all the relatives and friends thought surely that this child was going to be called Zacharias.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,480
Zacharias after its father.

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,360
And they turned to Elizabeth, the mother, and they asked her,

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,860
and she said,

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,760
No, we are not going to call him Zacharias.

46
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,420
We are going to call him John.

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,600
And they said,

48
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,220
But nobody else in the family has the name John.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,660
Why do you want to call him John?

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,940
And then they turned to Zacharias.

51
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,800
Now Zacharias had not spoken a word for nine months,

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,220
not since the time that the angel had come,

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,360
and had said that his wife Elizabeth and he would become parents of a child.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,180
And they motioned to him,

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,560
What shall we call this child?

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,800
And he motioned then for a tablet,

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,620
and he wrote on a tablet,

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,320
His name shall be called John.

59
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,860
And then it was that his speech was regained,

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,340
and he was able to talk,

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,820
and we are told that he, being filled with the Holy Ghost,

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,500
began to prophesy.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,520
And he began to talk about his son,

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,820
and also about the birth of Jesus,

65
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,920
even though Jesus was not as yet born in Bethlehem.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,080
It was still six months before the birth of Jesus.

67
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,460
But in prophecy,

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,820
Zacharias sees it as something already having happened,

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,060
and this is what he said.

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,900
Oh, there were a number of times

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,340
when Zacharias, early in the morning from the temple,

72
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,440
would look out,

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,840
and he would see the dawn of a new day,

74
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,900
see the beginning of a new day.

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,440
And so when he thought of this Jesus that was going to come,

76
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,320
he said this about him,

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,380
He is the day spring from on high.

78
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,320
The day spring from on high hath visited us.

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,560
He is the spring of day.

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,120
He is the beginning of a new day.

81
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,460
He is the dawn of a new day.

82
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,900
That's who this infant Jesus is.

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,780
And today, as Zacharias speaks to you and me

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,080
from the word of God,

85
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,260
and we ask him,

86
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,280
Zacharias, who is this Jesus,

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,040
the manger child of Bethlehem?

88
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,480
Zacharias says,

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,940
Do you not know who he is?

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,360
He is the day spring from heaven.

91
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,060
He is the dawn of a new day.

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,180
He is the new day of hope

93
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,780
and comfort and joy for the world.

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,660
He is the one whose coming

95
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,660
has meant a new day of hope in this world.

96
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,460
That's who he is.

97
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,020
And you and I on this first Sunday in Advent

98
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
getting ready for Christmas,

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,740
we may say,

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,480
Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration?

101
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,080
That Jesus is the new day from heaven?

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,240
That his coming has brought a new day into this world

103
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,480
that would never have happened had he not come?

104
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,800
Isn't that stretching it just a little bit too far?

105
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,960
Isn't that an overstatement?

106
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,680
And yet on the basis of the word of God today

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
as we get ready for Christmas,

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,940
is let's know this,

109
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,460
that when Zacharias likened Jesus

110
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,220
to the dawn of a new day,

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
he is the new day that has come from heaven,

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,360
that is no exaggeration,

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,640
that is no stretching of truth,

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,240
because just as surely as God lives,

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
let's know this,

116
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,500
that Jesus,

117
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,580
by his coming from heaven,

118
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,640
he brought a new day of hope to this world

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,800
that this world would never have had

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,080
had Jesus not come.

121
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,760
There is no exaggeration,

122
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,700
there is no stretching here whatsoever.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,160
Let's look on this first Sunday then

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,580
at what Zacharias tells us about

125
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,440
this manger child of Bethlehem.

126
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,580
He is the day spring from heaven.

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,380
He's the dawn of a new day.

128
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,280
He is a new day of hope for this world.

129
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,960
And he is because had he not come,

130
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
there would never have been

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,560
a new day of hope for this world.

132
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,740
Because in the first place,

133
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,960
let's know this on the basis of the word of God,

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
that Jesus,

135
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,080
the day spring from heaven,

136
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,420
the new day from heaven,

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,220
he came to bring light to them

138
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
that sit in darkness

139
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,880
and in the shadow of death.

140
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,440
Do you realize that if Christ

141
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,380
had not come into this world,

142
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,360
there would be no light

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,780
to men in darkness,

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,800
there would be no light

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
to men who are sitting

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,040
in the shadow of death?

147
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,080
What do you mean by light in darkness?

148
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,740
What do you mean by death?

149
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,980
Had Christ not come,

150
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,740
no man would know

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,580
his true spiritual condition.

152
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,800
But you may say,

153
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,540
but we still had the Old Testament,

154
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,280
did we not?

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,320
And do we not have the New Testament?

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,100
So would it have made much difference

157
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,440
if Christ did not come?

158
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
But the thing that you and I

159
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,980
must bear in mind this morning is this.

160
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,060
Had Jesus Christ not come,

161
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,020
there would not have been an Old Testament.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,740
There would never have been a New Testament.

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,160
The Old Testament testifies of Christ.

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,100
And therefore,

165
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,480
had Jesus not planned on coming,

166
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,300
God would never have given us

167
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,940
the Old Testament covenant.

168
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,120
You and I wouldn't have it.

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,740
And because Christ came,

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
and that means because we have

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,840
the Word of God

172
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,900
which testifies about him,

173
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,520
therefore you and I know this,

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,940
that we would never know otherwise

175
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,280
if he had not come.

176
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,400
We know that we are sinners

177
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,720
in the sight of God.

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,260
We know that we are lost sinners

179
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,580
in the sight of God.

180
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,220
We know that we are condemned sinners

181
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,400
in the sight of God.

182
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
We know that we are lost in sin.

183
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,920
We know therefore that a just God

184
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
looks at you and me

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,300
and condemns us because of his justice.

186
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,460
That we would never know

187
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,260
had Christ not come into the world

188
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,680
to give us light

189
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,980
because you and I sit in darkness

190
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,580
and we sit in the very shadow of death,

191
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,640
yes, eternal death,

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,060
and eternal hell.

193
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,780
And thus because he is the new day,

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
he is the day spring from on high,

195
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,100
he is the one who has brought

196
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,220
deliverance from hell

197
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,060
for this world.

198
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,660
You can't exaggerate

199
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,540
what the coming of Jesus Christ

200
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,840
has meant into this world.

201
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,180
No Christ,

202
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,840
there would be no deliverance

203
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,680
from eternal death and hell

204
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,300
for any man

205
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,480
because no man can be his own savior

206
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,960
who can bring a clean thing

207
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
out of an unclean,

208
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
not one.

209
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,880
And so there was no exaggeration

210
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,820
when Zacharias, the priest of God,

211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,060
in prophecy,

212
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
looking at this child

213
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
who was yet unborn,

214
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,600
said of him,

215
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,120
why he's the dawn of a new day.

216
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,020
He is the day spring from heaven.

217
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,240
He is the beginning of something new.

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,720
He is the one who has brought

219
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,340
a new day of hope to the world.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,180
Without Jesus Christ,

221
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,040
no man would know the way of salvation.

222
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,100
no man would be delivered

223
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,520
from eternal death

224
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,660
in hell,

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,200
both body and soul.

226
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
And that's why on this first Sunday

227
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,580
in Advent,

228
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,020
when we're getting ready for Christmas

229
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,620
and we're asking ourselves,

230
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,380
well, whose birthday

231
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,700
are we really celebrating?

232
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Who is this, Jesus?

233
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
We ought to say to ourselves,

234
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,760
well,

235
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,980
Zacharias tells us

236
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,320
that he is the new day from heaven.

237
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,060
He is the dawn of a new day.

238
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,920
He is the one

239
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
that has brought a day of hope

240
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,980
to this world

241
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,360
that the world would never have

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,500
had he not come.

243
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,080
And we ought to write that

244
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,660
onto our hearts this morning.

245
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,660
And if you and I would do that

246
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,040
as we're getting ready for Christmas,

247
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
then we would begin

248
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
to give him credit also

249
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,220
because he has come

250
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,920
for the byproducts

251
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,480
that this world enjoys.

252
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,900
Because the coming of Jesus Christ.

253
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,340
How many of us stand

254
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,900
and give Christ credit

255
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,560
for the byproducts of his coming,

256
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,860
the new day in the world?

257
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,580
All that you have to do

258
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,900
is stand someday

259
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,260
in a nation

260
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,660
where the spirit

261
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,880
of Jesus Christ

262
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,860
doesn't rule.

263
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,820
And let me tell you

264
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,540
when you are in such a nation

265
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,720
that seemingly is untouched

266
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
by the spirit

267
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,780
of Christ's coming,

268
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,040
it will write

269
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
an indelible mark

270
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,020
on your soul

271
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,280
that you'll never forget.

272
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,900
And you'll say to yourself,

273
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,300
I never realize

274
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,040
what Christ's coming

275
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,780
has really meant

276
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,540
in this world.

277
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
You and I talk glibly

278
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,580
about a democracy.

279
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,540
Demos meaning people

280
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,860
and crosses power,

281
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,000
power in the hands

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,780
of the people.

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,140
Do you realize

284
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,500
that a democratic way

285
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,520
of life,

286
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,440
liberty of the individual

287
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,660
is a byproduct

288
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,480
of the coming

289
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
of Jesus Christ

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,520
into this world?

291
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,220
When Jesus came

292
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,840
and testified

293
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,700
that all men

294
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,360
stand equal

295
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,380
in the sight of God,

296
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,340
that all men

297
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,880
are precious,

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,860
if all men

299
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,360
are free

300
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,380
in the sight of God,

301
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,320
then all men

302
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,080
shall be free

303
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,980
among themselves.

304
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,700
it came

305
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
from Christ.

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
Stand in a nation

307
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,760
where man

308
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,340
doesn't have

309
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,880
his freedom.

310
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,780
And I'll show you

311
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,160
a nation

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,280
that has repudiated

313
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,260
Jesus Christ.

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,580
Another thing,

315
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,560
go into some

316
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,280
of these nations

317
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,100
where the spirit

318
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,560
of Christ

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,740
is not predominant

320
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
and see if you

321
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,660
find mercy.

322
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,740
I have seen

323
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,120
under Muslimism

324
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
widows who have

325
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,820
been disowned

326
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,760
by their husbands

327
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,560
standing with babes

328
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,000
and infants

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
in their hands,

330
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,760
crying and screaming

331
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,380
at the top

332
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:21,900
of their voice

333
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,440
for a piece

334
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,080
of bread.

335
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,860
I never saw

336
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,080
such poverty.

337
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,880
I have never

338
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,460
seen such a lack

339
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,980
of mercy.

340
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,860
It'll haunt me

341
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,340
for the rest

342
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,000
of my life.

343
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,600
Where did mercy

344
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,460
come from

345
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,160
in this world?

346
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,840
How does it come

347
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,920
we've got hospitals?

348
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
How does it come

349
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,880
that we take care

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,980
of our children,

351
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
crippled children,

352
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,040
retired children?

353
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,420
Why?

354
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,840
Because Christ

355
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,300
as a byproduct

356
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,180
brought mercy

357
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,040
into this world.

358
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,340
Go into the nations

359
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,680
untouched by Christ

360
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,180
and go back

361
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,280
before his coming

362
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,920
and children

363
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,720
that were born

364
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
without perfect bodies

365
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,420
or minds

366
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,620
were given to the animals,

367
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,200
the wolves,

368
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,840
to eat up.

369
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,240
You women,

370
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
had Jesus Christ

371
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,060
not come into this world

372
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,420
in India

373
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,400
under Hinduism,

374
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,340
it would be better

375
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,380
that you had been born

376
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,100
a cow

377
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,400
rather than a female

378
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,780
because in Hinduism

379
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,460
cows are more sacred

380
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,140
than females.

381
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,400
You look in this world

382
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,980
and we say

383
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,200
the byproducts

384
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,180
of Christ's coming,

385
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,160
the very fact

386
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,400
that we can enjoy

387
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,940
again for our children

388
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,860
and education,

389
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,180
the very fact

390
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,120
that we have learned

391
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,780
mercy,

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,740
some of it,

393
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,120
those are the byproducts

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,800
of his coming.

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,100
Why don't we give him credit?

396
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,260
I wonder

397
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
how many within

398
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,400
the sound of my voice

399
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
may have this happen

400
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,680
to them.

401
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,700
Oh, you may never

402
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,340
have embraced

403
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Jesus Christ

404
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,560
as your Lord and Savior,

405
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,960
but I wonder

406
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,580
if someday

407
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,320
when you stand

408
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,940
before him

409
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,680
that he will turn

410
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,180
to you and say

411
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,760
and you weren't

412
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,660
even a gentleman

413
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,100
enough

414
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,840
to even say

415
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,880
thanks for my

416
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,020
byproducts.

417
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,040
You accepted them

418
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,940
and you never

419
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,860
said a good word

420
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,460
for me

421
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,080
because you were

422
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,800
so selfish

423
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,620
and you took

424
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,600
them for granted.

425
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,760
Depart from me

426
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,040
I will spew thee

427
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
out of my mouth.

428
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
I don't care

429
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
who you are,

430
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,220
friend.

431
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,560
If you're going

432
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,220
to be honest

433
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,080
and decent,

434
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,160
at least tell him

435
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
thank you

436
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,060
for the byproducts

437
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,760
that you're enjoying

438
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,560
in this country

439
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,720
even if you repudiate

440
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,440
him as Lord

441
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,980
and Savior.

442
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,340
It's only the decent

443
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,020
gentlemanly thing

444
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,640
to do.

445
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,420
Getting ready

446
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,400
for Christmas

447
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,940
and we say

448
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,320
what did his coming do?

449
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,260
Was that coming

450
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,300
so pretentious

451
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
and so marvelous

452
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,340
that had he not

453
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,300
come this world

454
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,380
would be poorer?

455
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,580
Zacharias

456
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,840
when he in prophecy

457
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,820
began to speak

458
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
of that infant Jesus

459
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,420
he said

460
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,960
why he's the day

461
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,300
spring from on high.

462
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,300
He's the dawn

463
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,060
of a new day

464
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,800
in this world.

465
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,400
He is the spring

466
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,220
of a new day,

467
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,840
the beginning

468
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,820
of something new,

469
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,820
the dawn

470
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,560
of a new day

471
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,200
of hope.

472
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,140
That's what he is.

473
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,800
When you and I

474
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,400
look and that's

475
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
no exaggeration.

476
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,800
Listen,

477
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
if Jesus Christ

478
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,100
had not come

479
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,460
we would still

480
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,380
be in darkness

481
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,260
and in the shadow

482
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,800
of death

483
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,540
without hope

484
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,260
and we'd not

485
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,000
know the answer.

486
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:19,960
There would be

487
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,560
no deliverance

488
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,260
but in the second

489
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,120
place let's know

490
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,460
this,

491
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,220
that because Christ

492
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
who is the day

493
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,360
spring from heaven,

494
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,240
who is the new

495
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,940
day from heaven

496
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,960
because he came,

497
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,660
he came in order

498
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,080
to be Israel's

499
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
horn of salvation.

500
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,220
what did Zacharias

501
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,420
think about

502
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,540
this Jesus

503
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,420
of Nazareth?

504
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,580
Oh, he knew him.

505
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Elizabeth had been

506
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,540
at their home.

507
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,760
She had, again,

508
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
and they had talked

509
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
these things over

510
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,440
and the angel

511
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,420
had also announced

512
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,380
these things to Mary

513
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,180
up in Nazareth

514
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,540
and Mary had come

515
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,280
down into this country

516
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,260
down in Judea

517
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,900
in the hill country,

518
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,020
probably Hebron

519
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,320
and she had been

520
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,100
visiting with her

521
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,920
cousin Elizabeth.

522
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,960
Zacharias knew

523
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,880
the story.

524
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,200
He knew that

525
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Jesus was coming

526
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,840
from Mary

527
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,260
and he knew

528
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,460
who this Jesus

529
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,480
really was.

530
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,380
He calls him

531
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,640
what?

532
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,500
He says,

533
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,500
and God hath

534
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,320
raised up

535
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,780
an horn of salvation

536
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,180
in the house

537
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,040
of his servant

538
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,580
David.

539
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,080
Let's ask

540
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,440
Zacharias this morning,

541
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,580
was Jesus

542
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,700
who was born

543
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,680
in Bethlehem,

544
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,300
was he the

545
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,640
Jewish Messiah?

546
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,140
Was he the

547
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,460
Christ who was

548
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,240
to come?

549
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
and Zacharias

550
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,040
with every power

551
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,860
that was his

552
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,780
empowered by the

553
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,360
Holy Spirit

554
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,120
would say

555
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,620
that Jesus

556
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,100
was the Messiah

557
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
that was promised

558
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,180
in the Old Testament

559
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,500
that the prophets

560
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,080
of God

561
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,900
had talked of

562
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,720
since the beginning

563
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,260
of the world.

564
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,380
He was the horn

565
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,180
of salvation

566
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,640
that came from

567
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,900
the house of David.

568
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,140
He was the fulfillment

569
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,400
of the prophecy

570
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,260
that was given

571
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,280
to Abraham.

572
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,900
Oh, my Jewish friends,

573
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,700
listen.

574
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,980
Jesus

575
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,260
who was born

576
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,880
at Christmas

577
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,700
is your Messiah.

578
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,300
He is your Christ

579
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,360
beyond the shadow

580
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,920
of a doubt.

581
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,880
Had he not come,

582
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,400
there would never

583
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,040
have been

584
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,840
and there never

585
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,520
will be

586
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,500
another Messiah.

587
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,540
He is the

588
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,100
one

589
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,720
and only

590
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
genuine

591
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Messiah

592
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
of all Israel.

593
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Zacharias

594
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,320
said,

595
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,300
he's the horn

596
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,920
of salvation,

597
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,340
horn,

598
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:23,900
the symbol

599
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,920
of the horn

600
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,420
of the bull

601
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,340
which is the power

602
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,040
of the bull

603
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,780
and therefore

604
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,420
a powerful one

605
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,580
this new day

606
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,240
from heaven

607
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,020
powerful enough

608
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,200
to be the Messiah

609
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
to bring salvation

610
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,280
to Israel.

611
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,300
Oh, his coming

612
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,380
has meant this,

613
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,640
that because

614
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,060
he is Israel's

615
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,040
horn of salvation,

616
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,640
therefore that

617
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,040
blessing of salvation

618
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,880
that he came

619
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,260
to bring

620
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,320
is retroactive

621
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,580
and it goes

622
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,820
back to the very

623
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,780
time when the

624
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,700
world began.

625
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,180
Zacharias

626
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,080
said the prophets

627
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,800
were telling

628
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,440
of him

629
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,740
this great

630
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,460
day spring

631
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,120
from heaven,

632
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,860
this great

633
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,560
new day,

634
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,600
this beginning

635
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,620
of a new day,

636
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,760
this new day

637
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,200
of hope

638
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,940
that is coming,

639
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,000
the prophets

640
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,100
told about him

641
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,920
which means

642
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
that it was

643
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,080
such a wonderful

644
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,700
salvation

645
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,500
that he brought

646
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,480
that even

647
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,260
from the time

648
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,000
of Adam and Eve

649
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,520
as they looked

650
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,260
forward to his

651
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,120
coming in faith

652
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,240
and every lamb

653
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,100
that was slaughtered

654
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,640
in the temple

655
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,280
at Jerusalem,

656
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,280
when men

657
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,160
slaughtered them,

658
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,780
they looked

659
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,740
forward in faith

660
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,480
to the coming

661
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,600
horn of salvation

662
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,720
which is Jesus

663
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,220
Christ,

664
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,920
the day spring

665
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
from on high.

666
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,300
Oh, he brought

667
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,660
salvation and it

668
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,600
was retroactive

669
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,640
in history to the

670
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
beginning of time

671
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,240
and it goes on

672
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,680
to the end of time.

673
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,320
We're getting ready

674
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,960
for Christmas,

675
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,440
aren't we?

676
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,060
When we say to

677
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,500
ourselves,

678
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,580
who is this Jesus,

679
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,700
this manger child

680
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,440
of Bethlehem?

681
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,800
Why, Zacharias,

682
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,960
again, who was

683
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,800
the father of John

684
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,400
says, don't you

685
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,140
know who he is?

686
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,440
Why, he's the dawn

687
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,080
of a new day.

688
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,880
He's the one that

689
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,460
has brought a new

690
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,380
day into this world

691
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,420
that had he not

692
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,920
come, there would

693
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,600
never have been a

694
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,440
day like he has

695
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,740
brought.

696
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,740
There would never

697
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,900
have been hope.

698
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,940
There would never

699
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,700
have been comfort.

700
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,620
There would never

701
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,860
have been consolation

702
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,880
and joy like he

703
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,520
has brought.

704
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,080
He's the day spring

705
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
from on high.

706
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,360
Getting ready for

707
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,100
Christmas over this

708
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,560
morning, we could

709
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,260
just, again,

710
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,080
write that on our

711
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,820
souls as we're

712
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,640
looking to Christmas.

713
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,200
Then again, we

714
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,420
would put into

715
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,720
God's hands the

716
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,640
thing that sometimes

717
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,100
vexes us and that

718
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,700
says, what about

719
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,280
those who have

720
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,920
lived and died

721
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,500
without ever

722
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,400
having heard about

723
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,340
Jesus Christ, the

724
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,120
horn of salvation?

725
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,320
What about those

726
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,980
in the Old Testament

727
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,660
who never heard

728
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,280
about Jesus?

729
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,460
What about those

730
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,260
in our time who

731
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,920
live and die and

732
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,500
never hear about

733
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,760
him?

734
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,560
What the answer

735
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,180
to that is?

736
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,080
What we put that

737
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,900
into the hands of

738
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,920
God, that's God's

739
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,620
business, but you

740
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,240
know, we like to

741
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,320
deal with that because

742
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,100
somehow or other we

743
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,540
like to get

744
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:39,840
comfort.

745
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,600
We like to say,

746
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,820
well, God surely

747
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,580
will never condemn

748
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,260
anybody who has

749
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,920
lived and died and

750
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,460
never heard about

751
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,900
Christ.

752
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,920
God will never

753
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,280
condemn him.

754
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,220
And then we get

755
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,880
behind it and then

756
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,520
we say, well, God

757
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:48,940
isn't going to

758
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,560
condemn me either

759
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,440
whether I accept

760
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,900
him or not.

761
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,520
If he's not going

762
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,060
to condemn them,

763
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,420
he isn't going

764
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,020
to condemn me.

765
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,220
You see, it's sort

766
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,160
of a shelter, it's

767
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,020
sort of a blanket

768
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,840
that we try to put

769
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,020
over ourselves to

770
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,960
keep us from

771
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,880
reckoning with

772
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Jesus Christ.

773
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
What God will do

774
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,180
with those who

775
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,640
have lived and

776
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,400
died without ever

777
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,300
heard about Jesus,

778
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,340
that's God's

779
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,720
business.

780
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,160
But you and I,

781
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,020
as we know who

782
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,880
he is, that he is

783
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,580
the new day from

784
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,360
heaven, we ought to

785
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,380
spend this Advent

786
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,060
season in telling

787
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,320
others what Christmas

788
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
really means.

789
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,760
How many know

790
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
what it means?

791
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,220
How many understand

792
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,000
what Christmas

793
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,460
really means on

794
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,160
the basis of the

795
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
word of God, that

796
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,400
it's the birthday

797
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,900
of the great

798
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,940
day spring from

799
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,620
heaven, the

800
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,840
birthday of a

801
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,740
new day, of he

802
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,680
who came into

803
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
this world, who

804
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,860
brought a new

805
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,820
day of hope to

806
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,480
this world that

807
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,020
the world would

808
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,720
never have.

809
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,160
Why, when

810
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Zacharias was

811
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,020
prophesying that

812
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,580
then he looked at

813
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,520
his son, eight

814
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
days old, and

815
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,820
he called him

816
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,740
John, and then

817
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,140
he said, and

818
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,860
thou, child, shall

819
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,040
be the prophet of

820
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,700
the highest, or

821
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,100
you're going to

822
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,840
be the prophet of

823
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,520
the highest, the

824
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,140
great one that is

825
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,300
going to come, and

826
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,740
you're going to

827
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,060
prepare the people

828
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,520
before his face,

829
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,520
before the face of

830
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,980
the Lord.

831
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,560
John the Baptist

832
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,640
went out and he

833
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,800
told others about

834
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,720
this Jesus, this

835
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,920
great day spring

836
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,960
from on high.

837
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,160
What greater

838
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,300
occasion do you

839
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,660
and I have than

840
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,340
to put that

841
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,060
Christ into

842
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,720
Christmas, to let

843
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,560
others know just

844
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,460
what is happening,

845
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,880
what we are going

846
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
to celebrate, the

847
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,520
birthday of the

848
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,500
great new day from

849
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,680
heaven, the one

850
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,120
that came as the

851
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,700
great horn of

852
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,400
salvation for

853
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,860
Israel.

854
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,080
We say to

855
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
ourselves, was

856
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Zacharias saying

857
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,320
too much?

858
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,660
Was it exaggerated?

859
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,840
Was it stretched

860
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,920
just a little bit

861
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,740
too tight?

862
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,960
Was it an

863
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,040
overstatement?

864
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,020
And oh God, it

865
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,620
wasn't.

866
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,500
Zacharias in

867
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,580
prophecy and thinking

868
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,500
about that child

869
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,100
that was going to

870
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,520
be born?

871
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,780
Oh, he says,

872
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,600
because of the

873
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,580
mercy of God, the

874
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,760
day spring from on

875
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
high has come, the

876
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,380
new day, the

877
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,120
spring of a new

878
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
day, the dawn of

879
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,320
a new day, he

880
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,260
who's coming has

881
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,160
meant a new day of

882
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,680
hope for the

883
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,020
world.

884
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,140
That is no

885
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
exaggeration because

886
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,160
had Jesus not

887
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,860
come, there would

888
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,980
never have been a

889
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,740
day of hope for

890
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,080
this world because

891
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,220
in the third place

892
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,140
we know this, that

893
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,520
this Christ, who

894
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,260
is the day spring

895
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,840
from on high, he

896
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,020
came in order to

897
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,280
guide our feet into

898
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
the way of peace.

899
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,700
Had Jesus Christ

900
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,400
not come, there

901
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
would not be a

902
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,280
human being on

903
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,940
the face of the

904
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,840
earth right now

905
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,860
that would know

906
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,660
how to come to

907
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,560
peace with God.

908
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,680
We'd all be

909
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,500
guessing because

910
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,300
had Christ not

911
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,760
come, there would

912
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,480
be no scriptures.

913
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,960
They testify of

914
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,920
Jesus, no Christ,

915
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,660
no scriptures.

916
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,520
How does a man

917
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
come to peace

918
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,240
with God?

919
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,780
How many in

920
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,260
church this

921
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,880
morning who are

922
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,080
listening know

923
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,240
nothing about peace

924
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
within turmoil and

925
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,060
unrest?

926
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,100
You're wondering

927
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,760
whether life is

928
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,700
even worth living

929
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,740
because you don't

930
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,080
know how to

931
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,200
come to peace

932
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,620
with God, that

933
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,540
everything between

934
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,860
God and you is

935
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,800
just the way it

936
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,520
ought to be.

937
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,080
Jesus came to

938
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,240
guide our feet in

939
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,000
the way of peace.

940
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,420
He came to tell

941
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,680
us that you stand

942
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,900
before God and you

943
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,000
tell God you're a

944
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,360
sinner and you tell

945
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,400
God you're sorry.

946
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,280
That isn't hard,

947
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,640
is it?

948
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,560
God, I'm sorry

949
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,300
that I'm a sinner

950
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,720
and I deserve to be

951
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,460
banished from you

952
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:09,960
eternally.

953
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,160
And then Jesus

954
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,840
has taught us

955
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,500
that we turn and

956
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,460
we ask God for

957
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,340
forgiveness for

958
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,400
Jesus' sake.

959
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,720
We say, God,

960
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,700
forgive me the

961
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,300
guilt and the

962
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,240
punishment of my

963
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,540
sins, not on the

964
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,340
basis of anything

965
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,220
that I have done,

966
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,680
but for Jesus' sake

967
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,480
who died on the

968
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,160
cross for me.

969
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
That isn't hard,

970
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,520
is it?

971
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,860
And on the basis

972
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,980
of Jesus Christ,

973
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,260
God forgives you

974
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,320
your sins and me

975
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,740
mine.

976
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,320
And when sin is

977
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,300
forgiven and God

978
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,140
has canceled the

979
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,660
guilt and the

980
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,540
punishment of our

981
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,020
sins, then we

982
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,720
have God's peace.

983
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,980
Oh, we may not

984
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,820
feel it at all

985
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,700
times, but we

986
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,520
have it and then

987
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
we go out and

988
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,600
we live that

989
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,740
life in righteousness

990
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,500
that we are

991
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,440
capable of doing

992
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,500
to his honor and

993
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,560
glory because

994
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,260
everything is just

995
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,280
right between

996
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,020
God and us.

997
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,240
Does peace mean

998
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,820
anything?

999
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,520
Without peace,

1000
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,800
nothing means

1001
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,500
anything in this

1002
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,140
world, does it?

1003
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,800
In a world of

1004
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
unrest, a world of

1005
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,940
restlessness, Jesus,

1006
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,240
he is the one who

1007
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,260
brought a new day

1008
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,880
in this world

1009
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,520
because his coming

1010
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,380
has meant this,

1011
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,100
that he has brought

1012
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,460
eternal rest for

1013
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,040
all men.

1014
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,320
And that eternal

1015
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,300
rest is heaven,

1016
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,080
that you and I,

1017
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,460
body and soul,

1018
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,520
may spend an

1019
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,780
eternity with God

1020
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,740
in his home.

1021
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,660
Had Christ not

1022
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,020
come, no man

1023
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,100
born of woman

1024
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,020
in this world

1025
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,480
would ever have

1026
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
the eternal peace

1027
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,340
of God.

1028
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,440
Yes, believe you

1029
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,460
me, you can't

1030
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,640
exaggerate his

1031
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,060
coming.

1032
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
And because we

1033
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,100
can't and he's the

1034
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,000
day spring from

1035
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,280
heaven, he's the

1036
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,440
new day, the dawn

1037
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,200
of a new day, the

1038
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,380
dawn of a day of

1039
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,420
hope, the dawn of

1040
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,200
a day of comfort

1041
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,240
and consolation, as

1042
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,880
we're getting ready

1043
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,700
for Christmas and

1044
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,380
this is the first

1045
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,040
Sunday in Advent

1046
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,960
and we look again

1047
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,560
into the manger and

1048
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,500
we say, who is this

1049
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,900
Jesus?

1050
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,800
Zachariah says, he's

1051
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,600
the new day from

1052
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,920
heaven.

1053
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,580
Ought we not

1054
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,740
therefore just take

1055
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,020
time this morning

1056
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,800
to look and to

1057
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
probe into our own

1058
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,560
hearts and homes,

1059
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,860
is that Christ, is

1060
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,280
that new day in

1061
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,580
your home and in

1062
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,640
my home?

1063
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,920
You know, Zachariah

1064
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,500
has had to learn a

1065
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,040
lesson too.

1066
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,320
For nine months he

1067
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,180
was not able to

1068
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,540
talk.

1069
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,260
Why?

1070
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,980
Because when

1071
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,080
Gabriel, the angel

1072
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,860
came to him and

1073
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,560
told him that his

1074
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,900
wife Elizabeth was

1075
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,580
going to be the

1076
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,280
mother of a child,

1077
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,120
he wouldn't believe

1078
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,620
Gabriel.

1079
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,340
So he had nine

1080
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,060
months to think it

1081
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,320
over.

1082
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,320
He rebelled and he

1083
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,280
couldn't talk until

1084
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,840
John was eight days

1085
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,360
old and then his

1086
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,000
speech came back.

1087
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,060
Then he knew what it

1088
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,540
meant to believe the

1089
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,760
promises of God.

1090
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,400
How about in your

1091
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,680
house and mine today?

1092
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,580
You know, coming into

1093
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,020
my office so often,

1094
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,800
husbands and wives,

1095
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,540
fathers and mothers

1096
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,520
coming with their

1097
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,980
marital problems and

1098
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,160
you get something like

1099
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,640
this.

1100
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
So often a wife says,

1101
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,920
well, it's just like

1102
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,220
this.

1103
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
I no longer love my

1104
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,900
husband.

1105
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,980
Or the husband comes

1106
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,420
in and says, I hate to

1107
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,140
be brutally frank, but

1108
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm going to tell you, I

1109
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,100
no longer love my

1110
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,480
wife.

1111
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,940
It's all gone.

1112
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,660
And then you see the

1113
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,600
ideas, well, when you

1114
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,840
no longer love your

1115
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,980
mate, why then you

1116
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,640
got to do something

1117
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,040
about it.

1118
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,840
You have the right to

1119
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,380
do what you want to do

1120
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,860
about it.

1121
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,200
You just break it up.

1122
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,760
And of course you

1123
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,740
don't care about the

1124
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,260
kids there.

1125
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,700
They don't count

1126
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,160
anyhow, you see, the

1127
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,520
big thing is the

1128
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,320
great ego, the

1129
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,980
great eye.

1130
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,460
I don't know what

1131
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,880
they mean by love.

1132
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,120
Oh, I can get a good

1133
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,780
idea that love is

1134
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,340
gone.

1135
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,720
They no longer

1136
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
thrill when the

1137
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,780
mate walks in.

1138
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,060
Or sexual desire has

1139
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,820
somehow or other

1140
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
been abated.

1141
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,940
And because that

1142
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,120
doesn't seem to be so

1143
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,980
paramount, love is

1144
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,520
gone.

1145
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,560
But I like to tell

1146
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,500
them that if you'd

1147
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,880
put into that home a

1148
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,740
different love, if

1149
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,800
you'd put into that

1150
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,500
home the new day, the

1151
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
day spring, there is

1152
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,660
a love that comes

1153
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,340
from obedience that

1154
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,700
you can control.

1155
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,240
And that love is to

1156
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,780
love husband or wife

1157
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,660
to the point that you

1158
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,520
want them saved.

1159
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
When husband and

1160
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,780
wife love one

1161
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
another, they say it

1162
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,160
matters not this

1163
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
earthly thing that we

1164
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,740
may call love, but

1165
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,560
we're going to treat

1166
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,860
one another in such a

1167
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,680
way that we're going

1168
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,660
to make the heaven

1169
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,420
journey a little

1170
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,600
easier, then there's

1171
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,760
a new day in that

1172
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,140
home.

1173
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,240
I know a little boy

1174
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,860
about six or seven

1175
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,980
years of age.

1176
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,680
Mother was combing

1177
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
his hair one morning

1178
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,540
and he looked up at

1179
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,520
her with the love

1180
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,640
that a kid has for

1181
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,600
his mother and he

1182
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,620
said, Mother, when I

1183
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,500
grow up, I'm going

1184
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,980
to be a good boy.

1185
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,740
I'm not going to be

1186
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,700
like Daddy.

1187
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,680
Am I, Mother?

1188
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,820
Just like the

1189
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,560
twinkling of an eye,

1190
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,780
she reached up and

1191
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,800
she cracked him

1192
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,060
across the face

1193
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,520
with her hands and

1194
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,400
she said, Don't

1195
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,140
talk about your

1196
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,200
father like that.

1197
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,420
He looked up at

1198
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,340
her with tears in

1199
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,300
his eyes, amazed and

1200
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,980
wondered what had

1201
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,400
happened.

1202
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,340
He thought he had

1203
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,640
said what she would

1204
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,960
want him to say and

1205
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,860
what would delight

1206
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,240
her.

1207
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,680
But there was a

1208
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,440
mother that was

1209
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,860
poisoning that little

1210
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,320
boy every day about

1211
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,000
his daddy, but when

1212
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,220
the thing was

1213
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,240
reversed and she

1214
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,140
heard the little

1215
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,760
boy repeating what

1216
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,760
she had said, then

1217
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,700
she saw how foul it

1218
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,900
was and she cracked

1219
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,260
him.

1220
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,900
But she was the

1221
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,740
mother that should

1222
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,500
have stood and

1223
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,580
cracked her own

1224
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,700
face because she

1225
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
was the poison.

1226
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,520
How about your

1227
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,060
home and

1228
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,320
mom?

1229
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,980
Is it nothing but

1230
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,700
poison from one to

1231
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,100
the other?

1232
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,920
And you're

1233
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,040
wondering why the

1234
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,220
children repeat it

1235
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,580
and it sounds so

1236
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,720
terrible when they

1237
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,660
tell you about it.

1238
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,260
What kind of a

1239
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,780
Christmas are you

1240
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,620
going to have?

1241
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,240
Zacharias early in

1242
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,140
the morning would go

1243
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,780
out and he'd watch

1244
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,920
the dawn of a new

1245
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,280
day.

1246
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,880
When he saw it, he

1247
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,660
likened Jesus to the

1248
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,700
dawn of a new day.

1249
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,860
You can put a new

1250
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,760
day if you put

1251
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,840
Christ into your

1252
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,260
home.

1253
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Did you ever go out

1254
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,600
into the garden early

1255
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,420
in the morning by

1256
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,040
yourself?

1257
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,120
Did you ever watch

1258
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,380
the dawn of a new

1259
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,800
day?

1260
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,780
Did you ever stand

1261
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,560
there and when you

1262
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,980
saw the dawn of a

1263
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,860
day, did you ever

1264
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,020
say there's the day

1265
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,620
spring?

1266
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,220
There's the dawn of a

1267
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,620
new day.

1268
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,520
There's the beginning

1269
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,400
of another day and

1270
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Zacharias, he said

1271
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,840
that's what Jesus

1272
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,580
is.

1273
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,780
And if you put that

1274
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,300
new day into your

1275
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,820
home, oh, what a

1276
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,380
difference.

1277
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,680
Can't you stand in

1278
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,620
the garden some

1279
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,680
morning and sing

1280
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,920
from your very soul,

1281
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,400
I come to the

1282
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,640
garden alone while

1283
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,940
the dew is still on

1284
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,580
the roses and the

1285
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,140
voice I hear falling

1286
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,660
on my ear, the

1287
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,640
Son of God

1288
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,660
discloses, and he

1289
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,140
walks with me and

1290
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,640
he talks with me and

1291
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,080
he tells me I am his

1292
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,460
own, and the joy we

1293
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,940
share as we tarry

1294
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,020
there, none other

1295
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,900
has ever known.

1296
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh, we're getting

1297
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,100
ready for Christmas,

1298
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,720
friends.

1299
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,980
Look into the manger,

1300
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,740
who is he?

1301
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,800
He's the new day from

1302
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,060
heaven, go out into

1303
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,480
the garden and see

1304
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,340
the dawn of a new

1305
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,460
day, and put the

1306
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,060
new day Jesus Christ

1307
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,120
into your home, and

1308
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,500
then I promise you,

1309
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,360
it can't fail.

1310
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,080
Yours is going to be a

1311
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,720
very merry Christmas.

1312
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,640
Amen.

1313
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,700
The peace of God, which

1314
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,840
passeth all human

1315
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,880
understanding, keep and

1316
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,980
unite your hearts and

1317
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,500
minds in Christ Jesus

1318
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,520
unto life everlasting.

1319
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Amen.

1320
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Amen.
