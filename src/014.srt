1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,460
Let us hear the word of God, as we find it written in the first letter of Peter, reading there in the first chapter, beginning at the 17th verse.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:20,660
And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:36,240
For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:52,000
who barely was foreordained before the foundation of the world was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.

5
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:02,020
Seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently,

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,900
being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.

7
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,500
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,940
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,700
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,780
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, our strength and our redeemer. Amen.

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,720
Dear friends in Christ Jesus, I hope that you feel at home here in church this morning, that you feel that you are among friends,

12
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,580
that we realize that we have the privilege of coming together on this day to worship our God.

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,680
As you know, today is the fifth Sunday in Lent.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,000
It has two names in the Christian church.

15
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,660
The one name is Utica Sunday, and that's a Latin word.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,740
And we get that name from the first word of the intro for today in Latin, which starts out Utica.

17
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,560
And in English it says, Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.

18
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,480
So this is Judgment Sunday.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,540
Then it is also called Passion Sunday.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,380
And that word passion means suffering Sunday.

21
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
You may wonder where it got that name.

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, as you and I know, we're in the Lenten season.

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,600
We talk about the 40 days of Lent, do we not?

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,740
And if we add up, however, from Ash Wednesday to Easter, and we add up the days, we get 46 days instead of 40 days.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
And we may wonder about that.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,620
Well, the answer is that the six Sundays in Lent are not considered Lenten days.

27
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,260
They are separate and apart.

28
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,280
But our forefathers in the church thought this, that even though the Sundays are not Lenten days specifically and definitely,

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:02,060
nevertheless, one Sunday of the six should be set aside, that it would take on the Lenten spirit and the Lenten flavor of the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ.

30
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,860
And so the fifth Sunday then of Lent is called Passion or Suffering Sunday.

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:14,160
And the word of God that I just read is very appropriate for this season of the year and also for this Utica or Passion Sunday.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,280
It's taken out of the first letter of the Apostle Peter.

33
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:27,100
And in this letter we find him writing to the Christians of his day, even as by inspiration of God he is writing to the Christians of our day, to you and to me.

34
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,320
And this is what he was telling them and what he tells you and me this morning.

35
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:46,340
He says this, he says, pass your time, he says, as you are in this world, he says, pass the time of your sojourning, he says, in fear, and he says, in love.

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,860
He reminds you and me that we are only sojourners in this world.

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,460
We are only strangers.

38
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,980
You and I are only pilgrims.

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,580
We're only aliens in this world.

40
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,220
And then he says, will you do this, fellow citizens and fellow aliens?

41
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,720
Will you do this?

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,520
Will you see that you're past your time and that you ever carry with you in these brief moments that you are here on earth?

43
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,000
Will you carry with you a fear and will you carry with you a love?

44
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,480
You and I may say, I wonder what he means by fear.

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,980
Not to be afraid of God because he's talking to us as Christians and God doesn't want you and me to be afraid of him.

46
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,560
But in saying, will you see to it that you take along with you every moment of your pilgrimage?

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Will you take along a holy fear?

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
And by that he means this.

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,580
Will you have a holy fear, a holy dread, a holy hoarder of falling from grace and losing your salvation?

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,100
Will you pilgrim?

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,420
Will you take that with you?

52
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,820
And will you also take with you another something that is holy, a holy love?

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:54,900
Will you have this kind of a love that causes you to long for no less than the eternal salvation of every man you meet in your pilgrimage on earth?

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,300
Will you see to it that you take along with you, my fellow pilgrims?

55
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,240
As Peter is saying, will you take along with you a holy fear, a dread, O God, anything but to lose salvation in life?

56
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,700
And will you take along a holy love, God, no less than the salvation of every man that I meet?

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,540
And you and I may say this morning, I wonder why the Apostle Peter calls upon us as fellow pilgrims,

58
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:24,540
that you and I who have no continuing city here, that we are to take along with us every moment of our pilgrimage,

59
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,520
this holy fear, this holy dread, this holy hoarder of losing salvation,

60
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,760
and to have a love that causes you and me to long for no less than salvation for every man that you and I meet in this world.

61
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,920
We may say to ourselves, I wonder what's so really wonderful about salvation.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,860
We may say, you know, I've heard it since I've been a kid in church.

63
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,500
We talk about salvation. Isn't salvation something that is a bit exaggerated after all?

64
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,180
That I should carry in life and carry with me a holy dread?

65
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,040
God, anything but that. Anything to lose my salvation.

66
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,960
And, O God, everything to the man that I meet, that I'll do everything I can.

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,720
I love him, that I want him to be saved.

68
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,520
And you and I may say, well, after all, is salvation so magnificent?

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,340
Is that so great? Is that so tremendous? Is that so terrific?

70
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,760
And we may say, oh, it seems to be so exaggerated, it seems to be so blown up, way out of proportion to its value,

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,240
that we may say, after all, if a person's saved, all right, and if he isn't, isn't it something that's all right to?

72
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Does it really make much difference? Is it so tremendously great?

73
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,580
When you and I turn to the Apostle Peter then this morning, we say, big fisherman from up in Galilee Way,

74
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,440
why do you say to us, fellow pilgrims, will you see to us that you will take with you a holy fear

75
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,040
of anything but to lose salvation and a holy love, nothing less than the salvation of every man that you meet?

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,440
And oh, because Peter would say, listen, friend, this thing of salvation, this thing is the greatest.

77
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,000
This is the perfect gift.

78
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,140
This is the gift that is complete.

79
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,920
Peter would remind you and me this morning why this gift of salvation,

80
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,240
even though it's become shopworn in your Christian life,

81
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,900
and even though you say, oh, it's all right, but after all, you can get along without it,

82
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,480
Peter would say, this is the greatest, it is the perfect gift.

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,520
God himself couldn't improve it.

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,460
God doesn't want to improve the blessing of salvation because there is no improvement possible.

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,080
It is the greatest, it is the perfect, it is the complete gift.

86
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,260
There is nothing that could be added to this salvation that would make it any finer,

87
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,940
any more beautiful, any more magnificent.

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,740
You and I may say this morning, well, preacher, you're going to have to prove that to me.

89
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,780
You mean to say that salvation is the greatest, that it's the perfect gift,

90
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,420
that even God couldn't improve it?

91
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,360
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,060
Even God himself could not make it any better.

93
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,360
He could not improve on it, one jot or one tittle,

94
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,080
making it any better, any more magnificent.

95
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,400
It is undoubtedly the greatest gift.

96
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,180
You and I may say, well, is that why Peter says, listen, pilgrims,

97
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,420
will you take with you a holy dread, anything but losing salvation?

98
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Will you take with you a holy love, nothing less than salvation for every man that I meet

99
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
in my short stay in this world?

100
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,140
Because it's the greatest, it's the complete gift.

101
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,380
It is absolutely the supreme gift.

102
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,040
It is in all respects.

103
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,060
It's the perfect gift because, in the first place, Peter reminds you and me of this fact.

104
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,360
It is the perfect gift because your salvation and mine in Christ,

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:51,240
it necessitated on the part of God that God paid the greatest price that even he could pay.

106
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,040
There was no greater price that God could have paid for your salvation and mine

107
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,720
than what he paid, and that price was the death of his only begotten son.

108
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,480
Peter reminded his readers in his day, he says, don't forget, pilgrims,

109
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,860
you were not redeemed, you were not bought back,

110
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,380
you were not ransomed with something like silver and gold.

111
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,300
He knew and I said, well, that's pretty precious.

112
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,780
Peter reminds them, but this silver and gold, this is passing,

113
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,340
this is something that is simply transient.

114
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,260
Peter reminds them, don't forget that in order to be saved,

115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,940
God paid the greatest price that even he could pay.

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,440
Do you realize that for your salvation and mine,

117
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,100
the greatest price that God himself could pay was the death of his only begotten son.

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,960
It meant that his son, the second person of the Trinity, from eternity would come into this world.

119
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,900
It meant that he would come into this world and become a human being,

120
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,900
to take unto himself a human body and a human soul from the Virgin Mary without sin.

121
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,440
It meant that this son, God's son himself, had to go to Calvary's cross

122
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:07,080
and there he had to take unto himself the very sins and the guilt and the punishment of the entire human race

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,020
and on the cross he had to bear hell and damnation for you and me.

124
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:22,840
That was the cost because there was no other way in order for you and me to be exempted from hell and damnation.

125
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,380
We say to ourselves, isn't this thing of salvation, isn't it becoming trite and sort of shop warm,

126
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:36,740
that after all it's lost some of its glitter, is it so tremendous, it's the perfect gift, it costs something.

127
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,780
You and I look at Christmas gifts occasionally, don't we, and we say, I wonder what it costs.

128
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,380
You and look at the package, don't you, and look at the box, and maybe they left the price tag on.

129
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,720
What was the price of the gift because we value the gift of the price

130
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,840
and God would remind you and me that salvation is the greatest, it's the complete gift.

131
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,080
You and I couldn't improve upon it if we lived to be a billion

132
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,040
because it costs the greatest price that God himself could pay,

133
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,560
the death of his only begotten son, and therefore what does it mean?

134
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,740
It's the greatest gift because what does it provide for you and me?

135
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:17,320
This gift of salvation provides for us in Christ the deliverance of our soul and body from an eternity in hell.

136
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes, I believe in hell.

137
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,780
Today churches are saying, do you still believe in fire and brimstone?

138
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,120
The eternal word of God still talks about hell.

139
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,580
It talks about the separation of a man's soul and body from the mercy of God.

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,380
It gives you and me a glimpse of it.

141
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,100
When on Calvary Christ cried out,

142
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,980
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

143
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,720
When he was forsaken of God, cut off completely from God's love and mercy,

144
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,400
he cried out in agony, this is hell.

145
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,120
Yes, the soul that doesn't have Jesus Christ,

146
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,280
who doesn't have this tremendous, this greatest of all blessings, eternal life or salvation,

147
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,740
this person doesn't realize you can't improve upon this blessing.

148
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,080
The greatest cause, Jesus Christ has rescued you and me,

149
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,060
ransomed us from an eternity of body,

150
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,740
and so in hell, separated from the mercy of God.

151
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
This is what it means.

152
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,280
And therefore, no wonder the Apostle Peter says,

153
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,560
Listen, fellow pilgrim, will you do this?

154
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,060
Will you carry with you every hour of your pilgrimage?

155
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,260
Carry with you this holy dread?

156
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Have the holy dread anything, God, but falling from grace and losing eternal life.

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,700
And if you and I would say to ourselves this morning,

158
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,440
I'm going to have a fear of God in my life starting today,

159
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
there's going to be one dread that I'm going to carry,

160
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,040
one fear, one horror,

161
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,060
that I don't care what happens to me,

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,500
this shall not happen,

163
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,620
that I shall fall from grace and I shall lose salvation,

164
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,260
because it's the greatest gift.

165
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,560
It is the perfect gift.

166
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,960
Even God couldn't improve upon it.

167
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
Then, if we would say that to ourselves,

168
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,400
then every time you and I are tempted to do wrong,

169
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,280
every time we are tempted to do that which we know is wrong,

170
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,220
we will turn to Jesus Christ and ask for strength

171
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,780
so that we are not lost and we do not fall from grace.

172
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,240
I know that there are a number of Christians who say,

173
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,000
Once in grace, always in grace,

174
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,700
that you can't fall when once you have been saved.

175
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,280
You ask Simon Peter whether you can fall or not,

176
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,640
and Simon Peter can say,

177
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,720
Do you mean when you're in grace that you can't fall?

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,080
Well, Simon Peter would say,

179
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,740
I went down like a ton of bricks in Caiaphas' yard that night.

180
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,980
I fell from grace.

181
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,880
And again, it is told traditionally that Simon Peter from that time on,

182
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,080
every time you heard a rooster crow,

183
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,360
he got down on his knees and he asked Christ

184
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,660
to give him strength that he wouldn't fall from grace again.

185
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,880
We used to have a church in Miriam that had a rooster on its tower,

186
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,580
reminding Christians going by to be ready,

187
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,500
to be watchful, to be on guard.

188
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,360
Let him that thinketh he standeth,

189
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,640
take heed lest he fall.

190
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,940
And we pray and forgive us our trespasses,

191
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,520
and lead us not into temptation.

192
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,180
You and I can fall from grace.

193
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,200
You bet we can.

194
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,840
Simon Peter, the big fisherman from up Galilee Way fell.

195
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,280
When we say to ourselves,

196
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,600
This isn't going to happen to me.

197
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,960
There's one dread I'm going to carry in this pilgrimage of mine.

198
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,220
It's going to be this,

199
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,720
that I am going to see to it that I shall not fall from grace.

200
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,400
I shall not lose this salvation.

201
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,460
This is the greatest gift.

202
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,560
This is the gift without compare.

203
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,820
This is the complete, the perfect gift.

204
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,400
God couldn't improve upon it.

205
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,980
It cost no less than the death of his son.

206
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,900
Then we will escape the tragedy of tragedies,

207
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,620
once having Christ to have lost him.

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,060
Judas had him too, you know.

209
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,780
And when Judas lost him,

210
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Jesus said of him,

211
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,640
It were better for that man if he had never been born.

212
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,660
There is no compensation.

213
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,140
There is no compensation.

214
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,860
Let a man say,

215
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,120
Well, it's all right if I'm saved,

216
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,580
but it's going to be all right if I'm lost.

217
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,020
There will be compensations.

218
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,180
Friend, there are no compensations.

219
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,060
There is nothing that can ever make up for the loss of your soul and mine in hell,

220
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,220
where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.

221
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,500
It would be better that you and I had never seen the light of day.

222
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
And therefore, again,

223
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,780
this is Passion Sunday.

224
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,860
And the Apostle Peter, he calls to you and me,

225
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,740
he says, fellow pilgrims,

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,040
Listen,

227
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,300
Will you see to it that you will take with you

228
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,020
every hour of your pilgrimage,

229
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,380
of your short stay in the world,

230
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,580
will you take with you a holy fear,

231
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,600
a dread,

232
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
God, this shall not happen,

233
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,300
that I shall ever lose salvation.

234
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,260
And will you take with you also a holy love,

235
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,300
that nothing less for every man that you meet,

236
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,520
that you long,

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,360
that he may have salvation in Christ.

238
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,740
And you and I may say,

239
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,500
Why is salvation so wonderful?

240
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,200
Isn't this a shopworn thing?

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,340
And don't we exaggerate it way beyond its real value?

242
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,520
Don't we blow it up?

243
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,560
That after all, it doesn't amount to much.

244
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,900
But the Apostle Peter would say,

245
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,000
Listen, it's the greatest gift.

246
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,020
Even God couldn't improve on it.

247
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,100
Even God couldn't make it any better.

248
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,960
It is absolute complete.

249
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,920
It is absolutely the very super gift of all gifts.

250
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,580
God, if he tried,

251
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,660
couldn't make it any better.

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,740
He doesn't try because he made it the very best.

253
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,800
You and I may say,

254
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,080
Did he?

255
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,300
Because Peter would remind you and me in the second place also,

256
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,360
that again,

257
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,200
this gift of salvation in Jesus Christ,

258
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,580
that necessitated also on the part of God,

259
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,480
that God giveth the greatest preparation

260
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,120
that even he could give it,

261
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,060
in making it possible.

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,900
Peter reminds his reader,

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,180
he says,

264
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,840
Don't forget,

265
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,600
God prepared our salvation back in eternity.

266
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
He foreordained it

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,360
before he laid the foundations of the world.

268
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:31,920
You know,

269
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,960
sometimes we may say,

270
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,580
Well, salvation must have been the second thought on the part of God.

271
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,080
God created our first parents and they sinned,

272
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,520
and then suddenly he came through

273
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,100
with a way to save,

274
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,920
and it was sort of a half-cocked idea.

275
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, the word of God says that it was back in eternity,

276
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,000
back in the ages,

277
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,820
the eons,

278
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,560
the endlessness of eternity,

279
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,840
when God,

280
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,900
in his foreknowledge,

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,760
God knew that when he would create a world,

282
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,060
and he would create man in his own image,

283
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
in the likeness of himself,

284
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,440
and even though he would create man perfect,

285
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,520
and give man a free will,

286
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,600
God, in eternity,

287
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,620
he knew that man would fall into sin.

288
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,240
I know you and I could stop

289
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,900
and we could ask a lot of questions here then.

290
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,840
Why did God go on and create the universe?

291
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,340
Why did he create man

292
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,240
when he knew in eternity that man would sin?

293
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,460
Because God,

294
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,340
still with his foreknowledge,

295
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,060
was going to save that man.

296
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,380
That man was going to get a second chance,

297
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,320
and in eternity,

298
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,740
God prepared our salvation.

299
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,820
It was something in the eons,

300
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,520
in the eons,

301
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,120
eternity,

302
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,260
timelessness,

303
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,900
that God prepared it in his son,

304
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,660
Jesus Christ,

305
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,880
that his son was to come into this world,

306
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,700
and this son was to die on the cross for our sins,

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,580
and that in his righteousness that he merited,

308
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,520
there would be heaven,

309
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,720
made possible for the entire human race.

310
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,700
This was a plan prepared in eternity,

311
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
before the foundations of the world.

312
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,220
God couldn't improve upon it if he wanted to.

313
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
He doesn't want to because he couldn't.

314
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,080
This is the greatest,

315
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,040
this salvation,

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,040
because it was prepared.

317
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,700
It was planned by our triune God,

318
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,000
Father,

319
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,260
Son,

320
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,940
and Holy Spirit,

321
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,580
already in eternity,

322
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,300
for ordained there before the foundation of the world was ever laid.

323
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,780
And therefore,

324
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,100
again,

325
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,060
it's the complete gift.

326
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,780
It's the greatest.

327
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,980
You and I may say,

328
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,080
it's gotten shopworn in my heart and light.

329
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,220
It doesn't mean much,

330
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,720
and I may say,

331
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,300
if I'm saved,

332
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,700
all right,

333
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,980
but it's all right if I'm not.

334
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,080
It's perfectly all right for those that want it,

335
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,100
but if I don't want it.

336
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
But the Apostle Peter would say,

337
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,800
this is the greatest gift.

338
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,420
This is the perfect gift.

339
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,820
You couldn't improve upon it if you lived to be a billion.

340
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,400
And I challenge you,

341
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
you add something to it

342
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,180
that would make it any more wonderful,

343
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,940
magnificent,

344
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,280
terrific as it is,

345
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,020
because it bestows upon you and me this.

346
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,840
This great blessing of salvation means that in the moment of death,

347
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,660
when you and I have Jesus Christ,

348
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
we are given heaven.

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,100
And that's the perfect bliss of being in God's home,

350
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,440
freed from any results of sin.

351
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,680
When Jesus died on the cross,

352
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,120
and he took the malefactor with him,

353
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,340
he said,

354
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,220
today is that thou be with me in paradise.

355
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,780
And what does it mean?

356
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,980
It's the complete gift,

357
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,960
that when death comes to you and me,

358
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,740
in that very moment in Christ Jesus,

359
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,220
come,

360
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,800
you blessed of my Father,

361
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,780
inherit the kingdom prepared for you

362
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,200
from the foundation of the world.

363
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,140
You and I may have a lot of questions about heaven,

364
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,820
but again,

365
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
when at death we go to this salvation,

366
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,120
which Christ has merited,

367
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,440
because we have his shed blood and his righteousness,

368
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,280
that is perfect joy.

369
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,880
There is fullness of joy.

370
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,480
You and I may say,

371
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,200
what does it mean?

372
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,800
Well, negatively,

373
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,320
you know,

374
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,660
we know it means to be,

375
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,340
again,

376
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,000
freed from anything of sin and sorrow and heartache,

377
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,520
and war and rumors of war

378
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
and loneliness

379
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,760
and anything that again sin may have brought,

380
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,320
to be in the very presence of our God

381
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,100
as our Father and Jesus Christ.

382
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
This is fullness of joy.

383
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,280
And because this is God's home,

384
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,340
God couldn't improve upon it if he wanted to.

385
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,740
It's the greatest.

386
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,140
It is,

387
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,560
again,

388
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
the gift without compare.

389
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,180
It is the complete,

390
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
it is the perfect gift,

391
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,500
because,

392
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,100
again,

393
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,120
God planned it already in eternity.

394
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,960
Therefore,

395
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,140
we ought to say to ourselves,

396
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,520
well,

397
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
if I'm only a stranger on earth,

398
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,440
and therefore,

399
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,620
Peter calls to me,

400
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
that I should carry with me,

401
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,800
not only a dread,

402
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,760
that I might lose it,

403
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,120
oh God,

404
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,460
anything but to lose salvation,

405
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,660
but I may carry with me a love,

406
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:26,940
that,

407
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,520
again,

408
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,280
causes me to yearn for no less than the salvation of any man,

409
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,740
that I meet in this pilgrimage.

410
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:33,980
Then,

411
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,800
if we would say,

412
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
this is the kind of love I'm going to have for my fellow man,

413
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
and this is the kind of love which will cause you and me,

414
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,140
then,

415
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,100
to turn to Christ and say,

416
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,820
give me the strength,

417
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,820
that I may,

418
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,420
regardless of the man that I meet,

419
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,360
that I may yearn for his salvation,

420
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,980
regardless of the response that I get from him.

421
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,200
Oh,

422
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,560
we're hearing a lot about love today,

423
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:51,920
aren't we?

424
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,640
Everybody's saying,

425
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,960
what the world needs is love.

426
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,960
This is the thing we need more of,

427
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,380
and this is the thing we don't have.

428
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,740
And then you begin to say to anybody,

429
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,100
what do you mean by love?

430
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,660
And it's strange about everybody in me,

431
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,780
it's got its own definition of what you mean by love.

432
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,960
We see some who say love means just to like somebody,

433
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,560
and to go out and kick over all the moral standards that we've ever had.

434
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,860
Go out in free love,

435
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and do away with marriage,

436
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,240
and if abortion is necessary,

437
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,040
go right ahead.

438
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,460
This is love.

439
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,260
Live it up.

440
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,820
Is this what you and I mean by love?

441
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,520
We turn to the word of God,

442
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,300
and the word of God says,

443
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,120
what is love?

444
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,980
What God means is this,

445
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,820
and when Peter says,

446
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,540
will you carry with you a love for the brethren that's sincere,

447
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,560
it's this,

448
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,180
that I say every man that I meet,

449
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,680
regardless of the color of his skin,

450
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,160
who he is,

451
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,020
or how he treats me,

452
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,340
that I have a yearn to say,

453
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,840
I hope that man has salvation,

454
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,860
that he can spend heaven with me,

455
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,500
that he can spend an eternity with me,

456
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,020
and that I want to treat him that way.

457
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,820
Here is the panacea for every trouble.

458
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,400
The president just last week called together a group of churchmen

459
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
from various denominations and various sects and groups,

460
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,440
and said,

461
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,460
you men have the answer.

462
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,440
The church does have the answer if it sticks to it.

463
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,280
What's the answer to all the problems?

464
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,800
What's the answer to the panacea in this world?

465
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
First of all,

466
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,140
the answer is that a man finds salvation in Jesus Christ.

467
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,240
That's the first thing.

468
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,120
That a man is restless until he finds a savior.

469
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,000
Until a man finds salvation,

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,960
which is that greatest of all gifts,

471
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
which is again the complete and the perfect gift.

472
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,120
And then that those who have found that salvation,

473
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,400
having this holy dread of losing it,

474
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,700
will turn to their fellow man.

475
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,500
And they will say,

476
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm going to love that man into heaven.

477
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,320
I don't care who he is.

478
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,800
I don't care whether he snubs me.

479
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,240
I don't care what kind of treatment I get from him.

480
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,200
But I'm going to love him.

481
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,080
And I'm going to yearn nothing short of his salvation.

482
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,520
That's the panacea that again will change the world.

483
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,700
And when the churches stop preaching salvation,

484
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,900
and when the churches stop telling fellow Christians,

485
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,300
listen, you've got to go out and you've got to love your fellow man,

486
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,080
that you want him in heaven with you,

487
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,380
then you'll know how to treat him.

488
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,360
If the churches stop doing that,

489
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,120
then again, God pity the world,

490
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,400
because the church will have lost its aim.

491
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,740
I am proud to be a minister.

492
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,560
I am proud to magnify it,

493
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,820
because again,

494
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,140
there are those that laugh at the ministry

495
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,420
and sneer at it and say,

496
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,300
what good are you doing?

497
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,040
But may I assure you this,

498
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,240
it is the very conviction of my soul

499
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,060
that when from the Pope of Jesus Christ

500
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,960
is proclaimed in his salvation,

501
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,060
that man, regardless of who he is or what he is,

502
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,760
as he proclaims that he is doing something for the eternal value of men,

503
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,180
and in so doing, he's got an answer

504
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,860
to all the wars and the hatreds and the racial antipathies

505
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,760
and the bloodsheds that you and I are experiencing.

506
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,940
And then there comes this joy, too.

507
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,500
The joy of knowing that you and I have done something for a man eternally.

508
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,420
Every other thing you and I do for a man,

509
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,680
it ends at the grave.

510
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,400
But when you and I can love him to the point that we say,

511
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,380
I want you saved in Christ with me,

512
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,280
and I'm going to treat you that way.

513
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,420
The joy, again, of having done something

514
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,560
for the eternal welfare of a man in this complete blessing,

515
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,000
and also having made the world just a little bit better

516
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,420
where you and I have lived.

517
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,480
This, again, is what Peter's talking about

518
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
when he says, listen, fellow pilgrim,

519
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,300
will you do this as you go through your pilgrimage in this short stay?

520
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,480
Will you take with you,

521
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,540
and will you have it with you every moment of your short pilgrimage,

522
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
a holy dread?

523
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,400
Oh, that you don't fall from grace.

524
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,800
Don't ever let it happen to you to lose salvation.

525
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,460
Will you have a holy love towards your fellow man

526
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,840
that nothing less than salvation do you want for him?

527
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,680
You and I may say, well,

528
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,260
oh, this thing of salvation,

529
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,000
I've heard it so long in church,

530
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,020
and I've heard it in Sunday school,

531
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,540
and it's sort of shop-worn,

532
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,280
and it's sort of exaggerated way beyond its value,

533
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,740
and you sort of blow it up.

534
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,580
What do you mean, salvation?

535
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,360
And Peter would remind you and me,

536
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
listen, this blessing of salvation,

537
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,360
it's the greatest.

538
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,680
It is the complete blessing.

539
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,540
It is the perfect blessing.

540
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,720
You add something to it.

541
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,460
Because he would remind you and me also

542
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,720
that this blessing of salvation in Christ Jesus,

543
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,040
it necessitated on the part of God

544
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,000
the greatest miracle that even God could perform.

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,140
You may say, what was the greatest miracle

546
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,180
that even God Almighty could perform?

547
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,280
You may start to guess.

548
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,560
You may say, was it the universe?

549
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,080
No.

550
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,940
On the basis of the word of God,

551
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,780
I can tell you,

552
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,140
the greatest miracle that even God Almighty

553
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,160
could produce and perform

554
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,300
was the raising of his son,

555
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
Jesus Christ, from the dead.

556
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,380
That was the biggest.

557
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,100
And if, again, your salvation and mine

558
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,740
necessitated on the part of God,

559
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,620
not just a miracle,

560
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,260
but the greatest miracle of miracles

561
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,020
that even God could perform,

562
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,500
then you and I had better take another look

563
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,700
at salvation and say,

564
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,780
it must be the greatest.

565
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,840
If it required on the part of God,

566
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,960
there is no greater miracle

567
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,840
that God could perform

568
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,200
than what he did perform.

569
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,400
The raising of his son,

570
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,200
Jesus Christ, from the dead.

571
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,440
As again, the verification

572
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,020
of salvation in him.

573
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,260
Don't you ever forget it.

574
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,120
When in your life and mine,

575
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,740
we say, oh, this thing's getting trite

576
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,420
and sharp on.

577
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
Who wants the church?

578
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,340
Who cares about salvation?

579
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,180
What's the difference

580
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,360
whether you're saved or not?

581
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
It's nice if you're saved,

582
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,100
but it's still pretty nice if you aren't.

583
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,660
Don't let anybody kid you

584
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,080
and don't let anybody fool you.

585
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,780
Peter says, listen,

586
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,080
carry with you a holy gift.

587
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,140
Don't ever let that happen.

588
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,880
And again, carry with you a holy love.

589
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,680
Bear in mind,

590
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,880
this is the greatest thing

591
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,120
that you can do for somebody

592
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,340
because it's the greatest gift.

593
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,700
Why?

594
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,220
Because what does this gift give?

595
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,040
It's so complete.

596
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,600
It assures you and me

597
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
that having a living Christ,

598
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,200
he's coming back

599
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,520
and he's going to create new heavens

600
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,060
and a new earth for his own.

601
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
Did you ever think what's coming?

602
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,640
When he comes again,

603
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,180
the present heavens and the present earth

604
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,760
shall be destroyed by fire

605
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,700
and there will be a new creation,

606
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
a new heaven and a new earth.

607
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,020
And our bodies will be raised from the dead,

608
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,120
mind you,

609
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,940
because of the tremendous miracle

610
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,440
that God performed in raising his son.

611
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,100
And we shall put on incorruptible glorified bodies.

612
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,940
We shall be reunited with our souls

613
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,520
and with our loved ones.

614
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,480
And we shall dwell forever and ever

615
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,860
and ever in a new creation,

616
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,660
new heavens and a new earth.

617
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,980
Does that stagger your mind and mine?

618
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,640
You try and improve on it.

619
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,100
You try and improve on salvation.

620
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,700
This is what salvation means.

621
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,120
This is what God has prepared

622
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,300
and this is what is coming.

623
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,760
No wonder, Peter says,

624
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,240
listen, pilgrim,

625
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,940
will you carry with you

626
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,460
every hour of your short stay in this world

627
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,840
a holy dread again?

628
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,900
Oh, the dread, the horror,

629
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,960
the fear of falling from grace

630
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,260
and losing salvation.

631
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,980
Will you carry with you a holy love,

632
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,700
nothing less for every man that you meet

633
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,460
and that he, again,

634
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,280
that he may taste of this salvation.

635
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,820
And if you and I can say today,

636
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,440
this is the way I'm going to live,

637
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,960
then we will also pray to him

638
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,540
to bless us and to remind us

639
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,100
that we are only pilgrims.

640
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,900
You know, God's done everything.

641
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,120
You talk about salvation,

642
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
he's given us a salvation

643
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,780
that staggers the imagination.

644
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,100
It's complete.

645
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,500
I challenge you,

646
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,140
you add something to it

647
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,200
that would make it finer

648
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,460
or more purview.

649
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,420
You can't because God can't.

650
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,200
Not that God is limited, oh no.

651
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,000
But when he provided salvation,

652
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,600
it was perfect.

653
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,520
And when it's perfect, it's perfect.

654
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,580
This was the greatest.

655
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,080
This was the finest.

656
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Then God does something,

657
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,700
he's thought of everything.

658
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,600
God says to you and me,

659
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,340
you're a pilgrim.

660
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,120
But I know again,

661
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,300
when you walk this earth,

662
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,280
you get yourself so tied around

663
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,060
with earthly things,

664
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,780
you forget it.

665
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,520
You forget that you're a pilgrim,

666
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,300
that you're an alien,

667
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,900
that this isn't your home.

668
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,820
And so God says,

669
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
in order that you don't

670
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,160
let it slip through your fingers,

671
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,740
I'll bless you if you ask me.

672
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,820
I remind you in my word,

673
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,760
and Peter reminds me,

674
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:28,880
he said,

675
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,000
remember all blesses is grass,

676
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,840
you're as a flower that fades.

677
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
The word of God tells you and me

678
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,120
this morning,

679
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,920
where for you and I say,

680
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,700
yes, I know it.

681
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,620
But you know,

682
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,260
God's got another way

683
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,240
in which he blesses us.

684
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,660
He's got a blessing

685
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,620
that sometimes you and I

686
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,580
don't think it's a blessing,

687
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,240
but it is.

688
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,720
He has the blessing of sickness.

689
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,580
Did you ever think of that?

690
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,320
When you and I say,

691
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,700
God,

692
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,620
I don't let this thing of salvation

693
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,900
slip through my fingers.

694
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,260
Remind me, God,

695
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,440
bless me so that

696
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,020
I will keep in mind

697
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,240
that I'm only a stranger,

698
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm only a pilgrim,

699
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,020
I'm only an alien,

700
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,340
this isn't my home.

701
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,220
And God says,

702
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,440
I thought of that too.

703
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,560
I will give you

704
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,880
the blessing of sickness.

705
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,540
Sickness,

706
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,460
it's the blessing of God.

707
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,000
Sometimes you and I say,

708
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,380
oh, why does God curse me

709
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,420
and punish me with illness?

710
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:16,880
God says,

711
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,660
oh, no.

712
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,100
I'm blessing you

713
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,920
with illness

714
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
and with sickness.

715
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,460
It's the blessing

716
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,980
with the tear.

717
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,080
This is its blessing.

718
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
When sickness comes,

719
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,520
that's when the tear comes.

720
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,800
And God says,

721
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720
now you're blessed

722
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,980
because it's only

723
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,080
when you've got a tear

724
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,880
in the illness

725
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,960
and you look to salvation,

726
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,720
you look to heaven,

727
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,060
that you see

728
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,700
how wonderful it is.

729
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,200
Then it glows.

730
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,440
But you've got to see it

731
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,100
through a tear.

732
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,440
And so God

733
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,420
sends sickness.

734
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,640
And I think this morning

735
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,440
of the blessing of God

736
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,000
in the illness

737
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,460
that he just sent again

738
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,220
to my sister.

739
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,180
I've told you about

740
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,320
my sister,

741
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,080
haven't I?

742
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,320
I've told you about

743
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
my younger one,

744
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,480
of course,

745
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,420
who died of cancer.

746
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,080
And I told you

747
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,020
about another sister

748
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,580
that I have,

749
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,520
my older sister.

750
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,380
I told you one day

751
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,020
that they took her

752
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,760
to the hospital

753
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,840
for a hysterectomy

754
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,700
and they opened her up

755
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,020
and they closed her back up

756
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,180
because it was hopeless.

757
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,000
And I told you,

758
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,460
didn't I,

759
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,100
that they said

760
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,680
they gave her

761
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
three to six months

762
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,440
to live.

763
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,340
This was it.

764
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,100
But I don't know

765
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,060
that I told you,

766
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,520
but it's seven years

767
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,620
since that happened.

768
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,500
Again, the pilgrim.

769
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,180
But just about

770
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,300
ten days ago,

771
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,200
the hemorrhaging

772
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,180
started again.

773
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,960
She called.

774
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,280
She's in the hospital

775
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,420
down on her back

776
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,480
and the doctor says,

777
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,180
we only gave her

778
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,860
six months,

779
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,800
seven years ago.

780
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,780
There isn't much

781
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,420
to be done.

782
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,800
But you see,

783
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,620
when you're in the ministry

784
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,760
and you take care

785
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,640
of the sick

786
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,420
and you're charged,

787
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,300
see, last week

788
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,780
it was Riverside

789
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,840
Hospital in Columbus,

790
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,760
it was University

791
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,880
Hospital in Columbus,

792
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,940
it was the State

793
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,880
Hospital in Columbus,

794
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,040
it was Marion General,

795
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,100
Marion Community

796
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,760
about every day

797
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,160
this week.

798
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,420
You see,

799
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,600
you can't get away.

800
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:07,860
But at least

801
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,660
by telephone

802
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,880
I can call to her

803
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,980
bedside

804
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,620
in the hospital

805
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,240
where she is

806
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,140
in Belleville, Illinois.

807
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,380
You know,

808
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,460
it's our gang,

809
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,020
the blessing

810
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,680
of a tear.

811
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,100
And again,

812
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,160
she told her husband,

813
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,900
my brother-in-law,

814
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,260
John,

815
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,500
she said,

816
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,780
John,

817
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,720
I've had a number

818
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,360
of years.

819
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,580
We've had a very

820
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,320
happy marriage.

821
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,380
We have no children.

822
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,120
But God has blessed us

823
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,420
and the time

824
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,020
comes,

825
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,540
John.

826
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,060
She told him,

827
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,720
when you get weary,

828
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,400
God wants you

829
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,120
to go home.

830
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,460
And again,

831
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,080
when illness

832
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,060
comes through a tear,

833
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,720
she lies there

834
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
and heaven

835
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,340
looks wonderful

836
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,660
because,

837
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,300
you see,

838
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,120
when you see it

839
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,940
through a tear,

840
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,040
it's tremendous.

841
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,560
God thinks

842
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,120
of everything.

843
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,860
I wonder if the day

844
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,500
shouldn't come

845
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:56,920
in your life

846
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,320
and mine

847
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,900
when we get ill

848
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,300
that we say,

849
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,640
thanks,

850
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,080
God.

851
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,520
This is just

852
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,440
what I needed

853
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,780
because it's

854
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,260
the blessing

855
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,180
with the tear.

856
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,340
Now,

857
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,800
heaven,

858
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,480
it isn't

859
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,380
shopworn anymore.

860
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,800
It isn't

861
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,160
an exaggeration.

862
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:11,960
Oh,

863
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,240
God,

864
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,060
it's beautiful

865
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,680
to go home

866
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,220
to be with

867
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,080
dad and mom

868
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,960
and to be

869
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,640
with sister

870
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
and to await

871
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,580
my loved ones

872
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:19,940
and to be

873
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,420
with Christ.

874
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,440
This is it.

875
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,480
Oh,

876
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:23,760
listen,

877
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,440
don't let it

878
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,240
get shopworn

879
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,920
in your life

880
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,480
and mine.

881
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,320
Oh,

882
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,820
Peter says,

883
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,220
listen,

884
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,280
just ask God

885
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,100
to bless you.

886
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,780
Let him send

887
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,060
illness with a tear

888
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,700
that you will know

889
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,840
I'm only an alien here.

890
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
This isn't my own.

891
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,560
I'm going home.

892
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,100
Then you and I

893
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,460
can walk the glory road

894
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,300
and oh,

895
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,180
when you see

896
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,560
Calvary with a tear,

897
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,120
when you see

898
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
salvation with a tear,

899
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,560
oh,

900
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,480
what a difference

901
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,840
Calvary looks like.

902
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,440
Then you and I

903
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,960
can look at it

904
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,460
with a tear

905
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,340
and we can say,

906
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,780
on an old rugged cross

907
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,740
so despised

908
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,860
by the world

909
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,520
a wondrous beauty

910
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,060
I see.

911
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,440
Oh,

912
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,040
you've got to see

913
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,620
it through a tear,

914
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,000
you see.

915
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,920
You've got to see

916
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
the old rugged cross

917
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,620
through a tear.

918
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,000
Now,

919
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,380
now it's something.

920
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,580
For,

921
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,240
again,

922
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,020
it was on the old rugged cross

923
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,000
that Jesus suffered

924
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,860
and died

925
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,140
to pardon

926
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,620
and ransom me.

927
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,740
so I'll cherish

928
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,240
the old rugged cross

929
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,100
till it lasts again.

930
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,320
I'll lay down,

931
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,120
I will cling

932
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,580
to the old rugged cross

933
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,100
and you say,

934
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
and exchange it

935
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,560
someday for a crown.

936
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,260
It's beautiful.

937
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,480
A crown.

938
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,880
Thank God that

939
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,780
God has thought

940
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,280
of everything.

941
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,840
it's the crown

942
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,580
as we stand

943
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,360
at Calvary.

944
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,600
And oh,

945
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,240
it's beautiful,

946
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,780
isn't it?

947
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,700
It's gorgeous

948
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,280
because

949
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,300
we can see it

950
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,040
through a tear

951
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,840
where only

952
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,320
pilgrims

953
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,820
tell the Christians.

954
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,140
Amen.

955
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,280
Amen.
