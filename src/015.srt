1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,760
It be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,300
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in the gospel according to St. John.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,320
Reading there in the 21st chapter, from the 15th to the 19th verse as follows.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:28,060
So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,520
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,100
He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,440
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,140
He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,100
Peter was grieved because he saith unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,580
And he saith unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things.

13
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,720
Thou knowest that I love thee.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,320
Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,040
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkest whither thou wouldst.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:23,100
But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,160
This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,060
And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,620
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

20
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,540
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,760
Amen.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:55,680
In Christ Jesus, our risen Lord, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,500
and you also Christian fans who are worshipping with us by means of the radio.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,260
Last Sunday, as all of us know, we celebrated Easter, did we not?

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,940
We celebrated that day that commemorated the anniversary of Christ rising again from the grave,

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
even as he said he would.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,780
And you recall that last Sunday we looked at this risen Christ,

28
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,540
the one that came back from the grave as he had said that he would,

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,540
and we saw that he is really the indispensable Christ.

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,840
He is the Christ that you and I must have,

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,020
that having him we have everything,

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,280
and lacking him we lack everything.

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,400
Well, on Easter Sunday, Jesus made some appearances.

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,660
He appeared to Mary Magdalene, you remember.

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,340
He appeared to the women.

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,380
Then on Easter afternoon, he appeared to Peter in private.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,580
Then came the appearances to the two men on the way to Emmaus.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
And you recall, then on Easter Sunday night,

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,740
he appeared to the disciples behind locked doors,

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,820
and Thomas was not there.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,020
On the following Sunday night, he again appeared to the disciples,

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
and Thomas was there.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Now, our text talks about the third appearance that Jesus made to the disciples.

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,880
The one was on Easter Sunday night.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,260
The next was on the following Sunday night.

46
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,060
And this third appearance took place up on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,320
It was not down in Jerusalem.

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,640
But in the meantime, the disciples had gone from Jerusalem.

49
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,680
They had traveled about a hundred miles,

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,840
and they were up at the Sea of Galilee.

51
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,840
If we were to guess, we would say it must have been about three weeks after Easter.

52
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,760
You recall that on the day of Christ's resurrection,

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,520
that the angel told the women to go and tell Peter and his disciples

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
that he will meet you in Galilee.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Evidently, Peter was anxious to get up into Galilee for this meeting with his Lord.

56
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,200
We are told that seven of the apostles were there.

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,660
Five of them are named.

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,320
We are told that Peter was there.

59
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,460
We are told that Thomas was there.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,440
That Nathaniel, or Bartholomew, as we like to call him, was there.

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,060
James and John, and the other two are not named.

62
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,300
There were seven of them up in Galilee,

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,840
about a hundred miles away from Jerusalem,

64
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,000
about three weeks after the resurrection.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,320
Then we are told that as they were there, it was evening,

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,380
and the apostle Peter said, I'm going fishing.

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,920
And the other men said, we're going along with you.

68
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,240
So they got into a boat.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
They rode out into the Sea of Galilee, and they were fishing.

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,600
And they fished all night, and they didn't catch a thing.

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,640
And then as morning began to break,

72
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,880
these seven men in the boat noticed that there was a man standing on the shore,

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,740
but they could not see who it was.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,360
But it was Jesus, the risen Lord, making an appearance to them,

75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,440
but they didn't know it.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,300
And as they looked, the man on the shore said,

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,700
men, have you caught any fish?

78
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,860
And they said, no.

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,140
And then the man said, throw your net on the right side of the boat.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,940
Evidently, they had had the net on the left side,

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,460
and they took their net and put it on the right side.

82
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,140
And when they did, there was a miraculous draw to fishes.

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,420
They couldn't even draw the net up.

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,660
And then it was that John, the beloved disciple, said to Peter,

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,440
I know who that is on the shore.

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,620
That's the Lord.

87
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,500
And just as soon as he said it,

88
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,440
Peter put on the coat that he had taken off,

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,480
and he put the belt around his waist,

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,160
and he got into the water, and he started to go to the shore.

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,500
The rest followed.

92
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,040
They were not too far away.

93
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,180
We are told only about a thousand yards.

94
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,000
And as they walked up on the shore,

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,080
lo and behold, they saw some burning embers,

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,380
some burning coals,

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,020
and there was fish on the fire,

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
and there was bread.

99
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,880
And then as they brought again the fish to the shore,

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Jesus says, bring me some of the fish that you have caught.

101
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,040
And that was put on the fire.

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,720
And we are told that not one of the seven would dare ask,

103
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,440
who is this speaking to us?

104
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,980
That they knew that it was the risen Christ.

105
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,140
And so on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,

106
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,140
early one morning,

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,100
about three weeks after Easter,

108
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,080
if we were to guess,

109
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,020
here there was breakfast with the risen Lord.

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,020
And then after they had eaten,

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,920
came the incident of our text.

112
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,020
Jesus turned to Simon Peter.

113
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,300
To understand this incident,

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,260
we must know this,

115
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,760
that when Jesus appeared to Simon Peter

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,520
on Easter Sunday afternoon,

117
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
while we are not told in the Word of God

118
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,520
what went on there,

119
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,680
you and I can very well assume what happened,

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,420
that it was then that Jesus forgave him

121
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,720
for his defection,

122
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,160
that he had denied him.

123
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,200
But there was still one thing that had to be settled.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,860
Was Peter to be reinstated into the Apostolate?

125
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,620
Was he fit to continue to be a minister of Jesus Christ?

126
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,100
He was forgiven,

127
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,300
but would the other men accept him?

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,740
He who had so boldly denied his Lord

129
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,600
on the night of the betrayal.

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,920
That remained to be done.

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,400
And so you can well imagine

132
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,120
that Peter was very anxious

133
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,400
for this meeting in Galilee.

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,820
And there, besides the other six men,

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,320
Jesus turned to him and he said,

136
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,520
Simon, son of John,

137
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,780
lovest thou me more than these love me?

138
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh, it brought back to Peter

139
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,560
what he had said in the upper room that night

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
when he had bragged about his love for Jesus

141
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
and he said the wall of them would forsake him.

142
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,660
He'd never forsake him.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
And it was that night, remember,

144
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,960
that Jesus said,

145
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,560
you will deny me three times

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,140
before the rooster crows twice.

147
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,000
And Peter didn't believe it,

148
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,080
but he had gone out

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,520
and he had miserably denied

150
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
the ever known Jesus.

151
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,700
And so Jesus comes to him and said,

152
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,900
Simon, son of John,

153
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,260
do you love me more than these?

154
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,300
And he could only hold his head down

155
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,260
and look and he said,

156
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,920
yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

157
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,940
And then Jesus said to him,

158
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,660
Simon, feed my lambs.

159
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,440
Here came the word of reinstatement.

160
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,960
Here was the reinstatement of Peter.

161
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,020
Peter, I still want you

162
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,160
as one of my ministers.

163
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,400
I still want you

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,540
as one of my shepherds.

165
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,660
When he told him,

166
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,260
you go feed the lambs,

167
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,600
there was the signal

168
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,660
you are to continue

169
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,700
as one of the twelve,

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,420
that there would be no question.

171
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,460
And then he turned to him

172
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,400
the second time

173
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,380
and he said,

174
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,740
Simon, son of John,

175
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,940
do you love me?

176
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,080
Do you love me as your Lord?

177
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,940
Not more than these,

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,740
but do you love me?

179
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,760
And then again,

180
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,400
with his head down in humility,

181
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,360
Peter said,

182
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,980
yes, Lord,

183
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,420
you know that I love you.

184
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,700
And then Jesus said,

185
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,040
feed the sheep.

186
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,580
Feed my sheep.

187
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,980
And then the third time

188
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,140
Jesus turned to him

189
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,660
on the shore of Galilee that morning

190
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:35,980
and said,

191
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,340
Simon, son of John,

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,860
do you love me?

193
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,500
And it hurt him

194
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,820
and it grieved him so much

195
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,040
that Jesus would ask him

196
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,540
the same question three times.

197
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,420
And then he said,

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,740
Lord, you know all things,

199
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,340
you know that I love you.

200
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,100
And then Jesus came back

201
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,000
a third time,

202
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,740
feed my sheep.

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,080
The thing that we are interested in,

204
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,800
in those words of reinstatement

205
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,940
to Peter,

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,060
when Jesus assured him

207
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,580
that he was still one of the twelve

208
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,820
and that he wanted him

209
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
to be one of the twelve,

210
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
three times Jesus said to him,

211
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,180
feed, feed, feed.

212
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,660
In other words,

213
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,360
the word feed means to teach.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Teach the lambs,

215
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,280
teach the children,

216
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,500
the young people.

217
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,540
Feed the sheep,

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,760
feed the adults,

219
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,180
feed the sheep,

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
feed the flock.

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,880
That's the interest this morning.

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Do you notice that

223
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,060
the risen Christ

224
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,380
had as his chief concern

225
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,400
when he reinstated Peter

226
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,460
that Peter should go out

227
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,640
and he should teach,

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,380
that he should instruct,

229
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,620
that he should nourish

230
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,900
in the word of God?

231
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,740
And as you and I

232
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,800
stand this morning

233
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,760
in spirit on the Sea of Galilee

234
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,480
and we hear those words

235
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,540
from the risen Jesus,

236
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,920
let us realize

237
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,740
that the chief

238
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,540
and the foremost

239
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,780
and the prime concern

240
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,640
in the living Christ

241
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
for ministers

242
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,760
is this,

243
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,600
for shepherds,

244
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,620
that they shall feed,

245
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,880
feed,

246
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,260
feed the flock,

247
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,380
that they shall teach

248
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,060
the flock.

249
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,080
You and I may say,

250
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,480
well,

251
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,860
this thing of teaching,

252
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,040
does it do any good?

253
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:12,900
You know,

254
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,980
sometimes we get

255
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,300
a miserable idea

256
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,220
about teaching

257
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,340
the word of God

258
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,700
because preaching

259
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,780
is just simply

260
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,340
teaching the word of God.

261
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,900
This thing of feeding

262
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,540
the flock,

263
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
feeding the lambs

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,660
and feeding the sheep,

265
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,940
we may say to ourselves,

266
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,980
what good does it do?

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,680
We may say,

268
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:28,860
oh,

269
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,620
it's nice to come

270
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,600
to church on Sunday

271
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440
and to hear the minister

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,180
preaching the sheep,

273
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,360
but after all,

274
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
isn't it a frustrating thing?

275
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,460
Does it accomplish anything?

276
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,620
Are there any results

277
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,400
that come with teaching,

278
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,920
with feeding?

279
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Evidently,

280
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,080
the risen Christ,

281
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,400
when he made it

282
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
the chief concern,

283
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
when he reinstated Peter,

284
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,220
evidently,

285
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,700
Jesus had the conviction

286
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,080
that it was

287
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,760
of prime importance

288
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,860
that the flock be fed,

289
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,520
that the flock be taught,

290
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,060
that young and old

291
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,760
be fed the word of God,

292
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
or he would not

293
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,140
have reinstated Peter

294
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,280
with those words.

295
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,360
We may put a low estimate

296
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,860
on teaching.

297
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,640
We may say

298
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,100
it doesn't do much good,

299
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,500
but today in God's house,

300
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,420
let's see,

301
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,740
if the risen Christ

302
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,360
made it of prime importance

303
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
that the flock be fed,

304
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,360
and that that be

305
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,700
the task of the shepherd

306
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,420
above all,

307
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,580
and the minister

308
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,540
and the ambassador

309
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,900
of Jesus Christ,

310
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,720
then we ought to say

311
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,300
to ourselves,

312
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
what good does it do

313
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,060
to teach the word of God?

314
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,380
Does it accomplish anything?

315
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Oh, this low estimate,

316
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,140
is it love's labor's lost?

317
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,700
Does it mean that all shepherds

318
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,740
of Jesus Christ

319
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,940
are only frustrated individuals,

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,440
only there to entertain

321
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,660
and to amuse

322
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,960
and not to teach?

323
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,980
Does it do any good?

324
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,480
Well, in the first place,

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,460
let's realize this,

326
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,420
it must do a tremendous

327
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,620
amount of good,

328
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,140
because through the teaching

329
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,460
of the word of God,

330
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,980
the Holy Spirit brings us

331
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,280
to a conviction of sin.

332
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,640
Anybody within the sound

333
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,300
of my voice

334
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,340
have a conviction of sin?

335
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,820
Do you believe

336
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,060
that you are guilty

337
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,500
of having broken God's law?

338
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,000
Is there anyone

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
who stands in the conviction

340
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
that because he is guilty

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,620
of having broken God's law,

342
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,740
that he stands condemned

343
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,080
before the sight

344
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,420
of a just God?

345
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,860
Is there anyone

346
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,660
within the sound

347
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,240
of my voice

348
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,600
who says,

349
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,540
I deserve to be banished

350
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,300
from the presence

351
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,480
of a just God,

352
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,720
because I have deliberately

353
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,500
violated his law

354
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,240
and I have broken his word?

355
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,740
Would the God

356
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,120
that there are many of us

357
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
under a conviction of sin,

358
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,020
but where did it come from?

359
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,620
It came from being taught,

360
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,380
from being fed

361
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,560
the word of God.

362
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,980
Because there's something

363
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,100
about the word of God

364
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,700
that isn't true

365
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,800
about any other word,

366
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,860
Jesus one day

367
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,540
put it this way,

368
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:07,720
he said,

369
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,760
my word is spirit

370
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,880
and my word is life.

371
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,980
He meant by that,

372
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
my word is spirit,

373
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,260
the Holy Spirit works

374
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,320
through the word of God

375
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,740
and therefore even

376
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,620
those shepherds

377
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,360
who are sinners

378
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,240
shall bring it

379
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,340
and even though

380
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,500
the pastor shall

381
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,460
feed the flock,

382
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,060
nevertheless,

383
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
that word of God

384
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,480
has the Holy Spirit,

385
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
God himself,

386
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,700
the third person

387
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,300
of the Trinity,

388
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,100
who comes to man

389
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,080
through that word,

390
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,260
bringing man

391
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,360
to a conviction

392
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
of sin.

393
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,720
Were it not

394
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,540
for the teaching

395
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,740
of the word of God,

396
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,500
for it not

397
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,220
for the fact

398
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,960
that the very shepherd

399
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,540
shall feed the flock?

400
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,900
How many of us

401
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,640
would stand

402
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
with a conviction

403
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
of sin

404
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,260
and be filled

405
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,980
with sorrow

406
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,640
and thus,

407
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,940
how many of us

408
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,860
would also have

409
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,140
a crying need

410
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,060
within ourselves

411
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,340
to be delivered

412
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
from sin?

413
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,860
How many of us

414
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,340
this morning

415
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,320
can say with Paul,

416
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,300
oh wretched man

417
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,060
that I am

418
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,540
who shall deliver me

419
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,300
from the body

420
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,100
of this death

421
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
when we realize

422
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,640
how hopeless it is

423
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,900
to be our own savior

424
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,120
and that because

425
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,900
we are lost

426
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,580
and condemned

427
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,780
that we need help?

428
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Where did that

429
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,200
craving come from?

430
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,260
Within you and me

431
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,000
that we shall

432
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,980
crave again

433
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,400
a way out

434
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,440
and have somebody

435
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
as a savior.

436
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,200
If you and I

437
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,180
can stand today

438
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,060
with a conviction

439
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,740
of sin

440
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,300
and we can stand

441
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,400
again realizing

442
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,700
what sin means

443
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,780
and that we are

444
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
hopeless and therefore

445
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,020
we must cry out

446
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,900
to be delivered,

447
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,320
bear in mind

448
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,460
it came from

449
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,060
teaching.

450
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,920
It came from

451
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,000
being instructed

452
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,360
in the word of God.

453
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,940
It came from

454
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,040
being fed

455
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,400
the word of God.

456
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,120
Without being

457
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,760
fed the word of God,

458
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,980
without the shepherd

459
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,720
feeding the flock

460
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,080
and feeding the lambs

461
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,740
and the sheep,

462
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,020
there would be

463
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,400
no one under conviction.

464
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,740
There would be

465
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,360
no one so crying out

466
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,040
to be delivered,

467
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,660
crying out for help

468
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,540
and for the savior.

469
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
And that's why today

470
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,520
as we stand again

471
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,060
on the shore

472
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,160
of the Sea of Galilee

473
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,540
and we hear the words

474
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,500
that Jesus the living

475
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,740
Christ spoke to Peter

476
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,700
in the presence

477
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
of the other disciples,

478
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
feed, feed, feed.

479
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,340
That was the chief

480
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,880
concern of the risen Christ.

481
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,500
Then ought it not

482
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,680
be the chief concern

483
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,460
of your life

484
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,120
and mine,

485
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,340
especially in our

486
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,260
homes?

487
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,140
Do you and I

488
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,100
love Jesus Christ

489
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,140
enough that we

490
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,180
say to ourselves

491
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,580
the prime purpose

492
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,440
in the home,

493
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
the real thing

494
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,240
that we must do,

495
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,980
we must feed

496
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,880
and above all

497
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,820
we must feed

498
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,780
the lambs.

499
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,620
Do we love him?

500
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,240
Oh, it was a sad

501
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,640
experience for Peter

502
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,280
to be sure

503
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
when Jesus said

504
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,300
to him three times,

505
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,600
Simon, son of John,

506
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,640
do you love me

507
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,120
more than me?

508
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,560
Do you love me

509
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,160
as the Christ?

510
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,580
And when Peter answered,

511
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,560
he used another word

512
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,940
for love.

513
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,420
He said,

514
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,960
yes, Lord,

515
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,840
you know I like you.

516
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,840
He was even afraid

517
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,720
to say I love you.

518
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
And Jesus the second

519
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,380
time said,

520
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,960
do you love me

521
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,420
at all,

522
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,220
Simon Peter?

523
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,480
And Peter answered,

524
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,260
Lord, you know

525
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,380
that I like you.

526
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,100
And finally Jesus

527
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,880
said to him,

528
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,680
Simon Peter,

529
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,720
do you like me?

530
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,580
Do you just even

531
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,220
like me?

532
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,920
And that's when

533
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,660
he was grieved

534
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,160
and he said,

535
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,780
Lord, you know

536
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,380
all things.

537
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
You know I like you.

538
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,720
He never used

539
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,780
the Agapon word

540
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,680
for love once.

541
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,260
How many of us

542
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,180
love him enough

543
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,780
that we can say

544
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,480
to ourselves,

545
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,780
this is the

546
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,020
prime thing,

547
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,060
this is the

548
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,720
main thing

549
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,440
in our homes.

550
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,740
I was just reading

551
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,440
what J. Edgar

552
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,340
Hoover has to say

553
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,480
about 1964.

554
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,860
Oh, again,

555
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,800
not to excite us,

556
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,280
but he said

557
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,380
in 1964,

558
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,460
you can expect

559
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,780
this,

560
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
you can expect

561
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,720
a 20% rise

562
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,500
this year

563
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,140
in forced

564
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,900
rapes

565
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,960
in our country.

566
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,560
Think of it,

567
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,800
20%.

568
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,820
He said,

569
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,680
you can expect

570
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,000
a great increase

571
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,560
in sexual crimes

572
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,360
in our country

573
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,040
this year.

574
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,560
And then he says,

575
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,860
you can also expect

576
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,320
a tremendous rise

577
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,960
in child molestations

578
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,040
by introverted

579
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,080
and sex-perverted

580
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,180
adults.

581
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,900
It isn't a very

582
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,140
nice picture,

583
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,800
is it?

584
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,020
But if the

585
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,120
risen Christ said,

586
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,460
this is the thing,

587
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,540
feed,

588
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,040
feed,

589
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,920
feed,

590
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,940
then you and I

591
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,700
love him enough

592
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,200
that we might

593
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,780
bring him into

594
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,760
our own homes

595
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,580
and stem the time

596
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,020
as regards

597
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,840
our children.

598
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,160
Oh, we put

599
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,080
such a low estimate,

600
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,780
do we not,

601
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,600
on this thing

602
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,660
of teaching.

603
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,600
And we say,

604
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,700
what good does it do?

605
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,500
And we say,

606
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,600
oh, what are the results?

607
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
It doesn't do any good.

608
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,700
Oh, you may amuse

609
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,500
and it may entertain

610
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,520
and it may again edify,

611
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,040
but what good does it do?

612
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,760
But nevertheless,

613
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,160
when the risen Christ

614
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,340
reinstated Peter

615
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,360
into the apostolate,

616
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,340
he said,

617
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,900
feed,

618
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,780
feed,

619
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,060
feed the flock,

620
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,100
does it do any good?

621
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,580
It must,

622
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,180
because in the second place,

623
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,700
know this,

624
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
that through the teaching

625
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,580
of the word of God,

626
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,940
the Holy Spirit

627
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,500
brings us to a living faith

628
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,640
in Jesus Christ.

629
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,100
Anybody here in church

630
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,620
this morning

631
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,240
or on the radio

632
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,880
who has a living faith

633
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,260
in Jesus Christ,

634
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,120
anybody here who said,

635
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,080
he is my Lord

636
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,860
and my Savior,

637
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
that I put my trust

638
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,500
in him for the forgiveness

639
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,140
of sins,

640
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
that I know that in him

641
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,600
and his shed blood,

642
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,040
that I know that I am

643
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,820
a saved soul,

644
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,220
if so,

645
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,880
the word you get it.

646
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,060
Again,

647
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,580
you may say,

648
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,600
I got it when I was

649
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,940
baptized as a child,

650
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,940
but nevertheless,

651
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,440
you would have lost it

652
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,120
had you not been fed.

653
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,000
Somewhere along the line

654
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
you were fed,

655
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,600
somewhere along the line

656
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,260
you were taught,

657
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,980
you were instructed

658
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,780
the word of God.

659
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,540
And when ambassadors

660
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,140
and separate to Jesus Christ

661
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,200
are to rightly divide

662
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,940
the word of truth,

663
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,980
they not only preach the law

664
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,860
by which there is

665
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,740
the knowledge of sin,

666
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,500
but they preach

667
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,760
the glorious gospel,

668
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,740
the good news.

669
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,380
They tell the story

670
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,580
that again,

671
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
God's Son came out

672
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,860
of the ivory palaces

673
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,140
into this world of sin.

674
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,400
He was none other

675
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,440
than God the Son

676
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,320
from everlasting God himself

677
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
and born of the Virgin Mary

678
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
took unto himself

679
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,580
a human body

680
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,320
and a human soul

681
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,140
without sin.

682
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,960
And he as the God-man

683
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,440
went to Calvary's cross

684
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,460
and there on the cross

685
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,280
on Good Friday

686
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,500
he bore the guilt

687
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,140
and the punishment

688
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,080
of the world's sin

689
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,120
and on Easter

690
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,100
he raised himself

691
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,660
from the dead

692
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,900
assuring that God

693
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
had accepted his sacrifice

694
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,440
and that in him

695
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,460
and his shed blood

696
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,760
there is life

697
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,460
and salvation

698
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,520
for all men.

699
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,120
And when that word

700
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,760
is preached

701
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
even though by sinful shepherds

702
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,620
and the flock

703
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,280
is taught

704
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,540
the Holy Spirit

705
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,120
that works

706
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,300
through that word of God

707
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,240
brings men

708
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,200
to a living

709
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,860
trust in Jesus.

710
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
It is the gift

711
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
of the Holy Spirit

712
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,660
if you and I

713
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,880
have come to trust him

714
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,820
and therefore

715
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,180
it does do something

716
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,240
without the preaching

717
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
of the word of God

718
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
how shall they believe

719
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,280
in him

720
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,820
Paul says

721
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,060
of whom they haven't heard

722
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,680
and how shall they hear

723
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,600
without a preacher.

724
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,000
And that means

725
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
that when we have been

726
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
brought to a living faith

727
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,880
through the word of God

728
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,700
in Christ

729
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,520
as our Savior

730
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,180
that in him

731
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,120
we have the forgiveness

732
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,760
of sins

733
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,920
we are delivered

734
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,580
from hell

735
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,660
and eternal life

736
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,300
is ours.

737
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,140
We talk about

738
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,860
a saved soul

739
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,500
what do we mean?

740
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,220
A saved soul

741
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,940
is one that has

742
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,920
the peace of forgiveness.

743
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
He knows that in Christ

744
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,800
Jesus his sins

745
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,340
are forgiven

746
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,660
that God has blotted out

747
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,680
the memory of his sins

748
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,060
forever.

749
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,600
He knows that the peace

750
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,500
of God is his.

751
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,160
The terror of hell

752
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,060
is gone

753
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,000
because he knows

754
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,140
Christ bore the equal

755
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,820
of an eternity

756
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,760
in hell for him.

757
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,300
The joy of heaven

758
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,880
is his

759
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,740
because he knows

760
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,340
the righteousness

761
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,440
of Jesus Christ

762
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,040
that he earned

763
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,720
on the cross

764
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,760
is big enough

765
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,040
even to save him.

766
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,340
Yet isn't it strange

767
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,180
when we talk about

768
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,580
teaching

769
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,840
when we talk about

770
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,180
feeding

771
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,940
we say what good

772
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,420
does it do?

773
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,700
We put such a low

774
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,540
estimate on it

775
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:37,940
and yet

776
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,660
upon the very shore

777
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,800
of the sea of Galilee

778
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,240
when the risen Christ

779
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,540
reinstated Peter

780
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,080
the very prime

781
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,020
important thing

782
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,500
was this

783
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,340
Peter go out

784
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,320
and feed the flock

785
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,240
feed the lamb

786
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,200
feed the sheep.

787
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,100
And if that was

788
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,840
the great concern

789
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,600
of Jesus

790
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,060
ought it not be

791
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,740
your concern

792
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,180
and mine

793
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,880
in your home

794
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,500
and mine

795
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,520
while it is

796
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,380
still

797
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,220
possible.

798
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,240
how many

799
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,700
of us

800
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,360
cry out

801
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,800
today

802
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,420
and say

803
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,080
it seems

804
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,560
to be

805
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,400
too late?

806
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,040
How many

807
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,460
of us

808
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:10,660
say

809
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,020
what do you

810
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,380
do

811
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,320
when you've

812
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,680
got an

813
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,660
18 year old

814
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,060
daughter

815
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,740
that says

816
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,540
I won't

817
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,180
do what

818
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,940
you tell me

819
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,360
to do

820
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,120
I'm 18

821
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,640
and I'll

822
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,240
live my life

823
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,940
as I please

824
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,920
and I'll

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,700
do as I

826
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,260
please

827
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,060
and I will

828
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,020
act as I

829
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,680
please.

830
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,260
What do

831
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,660
you do?

832
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,740
What do

833
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,100
you do

834
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,520
when you have

835
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,980
a son

836
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,340
that looks

837
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,700
at you

838
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,140
and says

839
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,660
I don't

840
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,220
care what

841
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,620
you say

842
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,360
I'm 18

843
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm 21

844
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,500
I'll

845
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,880
live my

846
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,520
own life

847
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:36,860
I'll

848
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,480
do as I

849
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,860
please

850
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,200
and it's

851
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,480
none of

852
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,080
your business

853
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,260
what do

854
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,680
you do?

855
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,320
What do

856
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,680
you do?

857
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,340
Oh you

858
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:44,840
don't use

859
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,380
your fists

860
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,880
I would

861
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,580
warn you

862
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:46,920
and I

863
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,220
have

864
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,900
don't do

865
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,240
it

866
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,100
because

867
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,060
one father

868
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,620
thought that

869
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,060
was the

870
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,580
answer

871
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,680
and he

872
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,900
prided himself

873
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,540
in his

874
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,040
physical

875
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,580
ability

876
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,060
but when he

877
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,420
looked at

878
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,940
his son

879
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,640
he landed

880
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
under the

881
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,540
table

882
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,980
when he

883
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,280
woke

884
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,600
up

885
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,400
you better

886
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,140
watch out

887
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,620
bud

888
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,360
that son

889
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,040
may be a

890
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,760
lot stronger

891
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,300
than you

892
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,920
think

893
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,020
what do

894
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,540
you do?

895
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,920
Is it

896
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
beyond the

897
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,500
realm

898
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,160
that if

899
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,740
you and I

900
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,700
have failed

901
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,520
at home

902
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,000
and our

903
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,900
kids hate

904
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
us and we

905
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,820
hate them

906
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,320
is it

907
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,080
beyond the

908
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,580
realm of

909
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,040
Christian

910
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,940
possibility

911
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,780
to get

912
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,280
together

913
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,320
and to

914
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,060
apologize

915
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,160
and to

916
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,840
ask for

917
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,600
forgiveness

918
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,480
think

919
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,620
think of

920
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:30,800
what

921
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,140
Peter

922
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,560
went

923
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:31,900
through

924
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,180
here

925
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,420
was

926
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,620
the

927
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,000
draught

928
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,180
of

929
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,500
fishes

930
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,640
that

931
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,180
morning

932
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,900
three years

933
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,180
ago

934
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,740
he was up

935
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,060
on the

936
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,660
same sea

937
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:37,920
and there

938
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,220
was a

939
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,760
miraculous

940
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,160
draught

941
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,540
of fishes

942
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,460
the net

943
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,140
break that

944
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,620
time and

945
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,100
Jesus said

946
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,640
I will make

947
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,220
you fishers

948
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,680
of men

949
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,600
that's when

950
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:44,960
he was

951
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,720
called to the

952
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,060
apostle

953
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,720
here again

954
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,040
another

955
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,580
miraculous

956
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,040
draught

957
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,600
and here

958
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,320
he was out

959
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,920
because he

960
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,620
had defected

961
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,160
the ranks

962
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,760
then he

963
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,360
walked up to

964
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,780
the shore

965
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,240
and here

966
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,660
again

967
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,480
were coals

968
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,820
burning

969
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,240
don't you

970
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,400
think

971
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,940
it reminded

972
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,200
him

973
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,560
that when

974
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,860
he was

975
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,520
in the

976
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:57,900
courtyard

977
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,240
of

978
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,680
Caiaphas

979
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,240
there were

980
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,880
coals

981
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,300
of fire

982
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,580
that he

983
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:00,980
had warmed

984
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,600
his hands

985
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:01,920
on the

986
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,140
night

987
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,440
when he

988
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,880
betrayed

989
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,440
was it

990
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,960
too late

991
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,780
and yet

992
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,280
Jesus

993
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,300
reinstated

994
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,740
him

995
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,500
I knew

996
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,960
a Columbus

997
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,420
policeman

998
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,240
very well

999
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,720
he was

1000
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,200
as hard

1001
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,740
as tax

1002
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,140
he looked

1003
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,440
like

1004
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,240
Jack Dempsey

1005
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,460
the

1006
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,900
Manasseh

1007
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,500
and he

1008
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,820
was as

1009
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,100
hard

1010
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,600
as Jack

1011
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:16,960
Dempsey

1012
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,180
ever

1013
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,540
thought

1014
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:17,960
of him

1015
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,020
he could

1016
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,400
curse

1017
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,040
like nobody

1018
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,360
else

1019
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,980
could curse

1020
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,560
it was

1021
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
again

1022
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,080
to stand

1023
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,460
it was

1024
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,220
blasphemy

1025
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,640
from one

1026
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:24,800
end

1027
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,020
to the

1028
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,280
other

1029
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,420
it was

1030
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,900
a man

1031
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,460
that never

1032
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,060
got along

1033
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,520
with his

1034
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,060
son

1035
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,580
the home

1036
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,880
was a

1037
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,060
hell

1038
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,640
on earth

1039
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,900
he had

1040
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,560
the red

1041
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:32,800
light

1042
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,220
district

1043
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,940
in Columbus

1044
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,360
one of

1045
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,640
them

1046
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,720
and he

1047
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,120
told me

1048
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,400
as he

1049
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,780
told me

1050
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,260
a story

1051
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,660
that he

1052
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,200
would walk

1053
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,640
the beat

1054
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,100
and at a

1055
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,320
certain

1056
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,760
time

1057
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,220
during the

1058
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,480
night

1059
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,220
he met

1060
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,780
the policeman

1061
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,440
on the

1062
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,060
adjoining

1063
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,500
beat

1064
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:43,780
and they

1065
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,420
would talk

1066
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,140
the other

1067
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,580
policeman

1068
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:45,980
happened

1069
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,280
to be

1070
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,920
a Christian

1071
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,200
but the

1072
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,520
policeman

1073
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,920
that I'm

1074
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,500
talking about

1075
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,760
when the

1076
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,140
other man

1077
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,580
talked to him

1078
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,120
about Christ

1079
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,600
he laughed

1080
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:51,880
and he

1081
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,420
ridiculed

1082
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,640
him

1083
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:52,840
and he

1084
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,940
thought

1085
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,100
it was

1086
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,520
the craziest

1087
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,900
thing that

1088
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,420
ever happened

1089
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,460
followed it up

1090
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,100
with cursings

1091
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,800
and blasphemy

1092
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,220
he was

1093
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,860
hard

1094
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,580
he was

1095
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,040
hard

1096
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,380
and then

1097
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,780
there came

1098
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,260
a scrape

1099
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,920
one night

1100
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,560
and his

1101
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:02,820
buddy

1102
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,220
policeman

1103
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,900
was killed

1104
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,600
then this

1105
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,960
hard-hearted

1106
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,440
policeman

1107
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,960
began to

1108
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,420
say to himself

1109
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,740
who hasn't

1110
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,080
I had been

1111
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,340
killed

1112
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,740
what about

1113
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:09,920
me

1114
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,220
what would

1115
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,300
have

1116
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,680
happened

1117
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,040
then he

1118
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,520
began to

1119
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,080
think about

1120
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,320
and he

1121
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,720
went on

1122
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,220
home

1123
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,140
and he

1124
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,420
had a

1125
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,640
son

1126
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,100
that hated

1127
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,440
him

1128
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,240
and the

1129
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,640
wife

1130
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,320
said what

1131
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,640
kind of

1132
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:18,920
a home

1133
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,480
is this

1134
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,560
but he

1135
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:20,900
had the

1136
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,180
courage

1137
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,640
to sit

1138
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,000
down

1139
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,280
and to

1140
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,600
say

1141
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I

1142
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,200
failed

1143
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,540
but we

1144
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:24,700
can

1145
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,320
start

1146
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
and he

1147
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,940
started to

1148
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,220
go to

1149
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,500
church

1150
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,720
and he

1151
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,120
came out

1152
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,420
to the

1153
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,960
seminary

1154
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,720
and he

1155
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,080
wanted to

1156
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,580
take some

1157
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,120
religious

1158
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,700
courses

1159
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,980
he used

1160
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,460
to study

1161
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:33,740
up in

1162
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,260
my room

1163
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,580
and one

1164
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:34,860
day he

1165
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,180
said to

1166
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,340
me

1167
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,740
Hansen

1168
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,160
would you

1169
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,940
come over

1170
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,220
to my

1171
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,480
house

1172
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,040
Friday night

1173
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,280
and have

1174
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,760
Friday night

1175
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,000
and have

1176
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,320
supper

1177
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,740
with us

1178
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,800
and I

1179
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,160
said I'd

1180
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,820
be glad

1181
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:41,960
to

1182
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,180
and I'll

1183
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,640
never forget

1184
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,180
that meal

1185
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,560
I sat

1186
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:43,780
down

1187
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:43,960
and looked

1188
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,140
and he

1189
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,460
said would

1190
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:44,920
you ask

1191
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,420
the blessing

1192
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,820
and I

1193
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,460
said yes

1194
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,820
when I

1195
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,300
was finished

1196
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,560
he looked

1197
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,760
at me

1198
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:48,920
and he

1199
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,160
says I

1200
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,400
never

1201
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,860
thought

1202
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,320
the day

1203
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,660
had ever

1204
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,040
come

1205
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,680
that anybody

1206
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,100
would say

1207
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,600
grace in

1208
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,180
this house

1209
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
and his

1210
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,880
wife looked

1211
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,240
at me

1212
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,540
and the

1213
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:55,860
boy

1214
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,280
and they

1215
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,660
said

1216
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,020
you can't

1217
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,540
imagine

1218
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,300
what this

1219
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
place was

1220
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,540
like

1221
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,320
this was

1222
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,860
hell

1223
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,660
now that

1224
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,400
Christ has

1225
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,900
come into

1226
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,620
this home

1227
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,200
when again

1228
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,540
there were

1229
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,060
three people

1230
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,340
that had

1231
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,780
learned to

1232
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,180
love one

1233
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,560
another

1234
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,280
maybe it's

1235
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,800
hell in

1236
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,780
your house

1237
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,600
sometimes we

1238
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,340
wonder when

1239
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,120
we come to

1240
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,180
church we

1241
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,060
wonder what's

1242
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,660
wrong with

1243
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,120
teaching

1244
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,760
God forbid

1245
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,100
that any

1246
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,720
shepherd should

1247
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,560
ever stand

1248
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,220
in the pulpit

1249
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,660
and not

1250
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,260
teach and it's

1251
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,800
a tremendous

1252
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,940
job but let

1253
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,560
me tell you

1254
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,200
no shepherd

1255
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,900
can do it

1256
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,460
alone if

1257
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,060
things aren't

1258
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,620
right in your

1259
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,060
house and

1260
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,680
mine it

1261
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,080
isn't going

1262
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,600
to do much

1263
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,120
good when

1264
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,660
you come

1265
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,240
here

1266
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,780
teaching is

1267
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,800
a tremendous

1268
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,620
thing

1269
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,100
it taxes

1270
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,880
a man to

1271
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,280
the nth

1272
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
degree oh

1273
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,320

1274
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,860
never done

1275
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,140
it you

1276
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,800
don't know

1277
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,720
this afternoon

1278
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,260
if you want

1279
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,520

on the top

1286
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,380

fourteen pages

1292
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,620
of what you

1293
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,220
want to teach

1294
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,700

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,340
it come from

1298
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,600
you then when

1299
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,080

it's up here

1302
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
that you don't

1303
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,360
have to read

1304
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520
it then you

1305
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,060
may begin to

1306
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,920
understand what

1307
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,860
teaching means oh

1308
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,440
it's more than

1309
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,760
just edifying it's

1310
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,460
more than making

1311
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,040
people feel good it

1312
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,260
is to tell them

1313
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,980
something to

1314
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,640
instruct them then

1315
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,140
you begin to

1316
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,000
understand what it

1317
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,800
means sometime to

1318
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,320
be up at two

1319
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,900
thirty when you're

1320
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,040
asleep or three

1321
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,760
o'clock to write

1322
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
down an idea before

1323
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,140
it fails you then

1324
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,720
you know what it

1325
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,660
means to lose a

1326
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,620
night's sleep to

1327
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,240
teach it's

1328
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,040
tremendous but no

1329
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,260
teaching from any

1330
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,180
shepherd is ever

1331
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,140
going to do any

1332
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,240
good unless things

1333
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,060
are right in your

1334
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,720
house and things

1335
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,980
are right in mine

1336
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,940
to depreciate and

1337
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,540
to put a low

1338
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,500
estimate on

1339
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,380
preaching on

1340
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,600
teaching let's

1341
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
realize the

1342
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,080
risen Christ when

1343
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,480
he reinstated

1344
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Peter to the

1345
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,100
apostle he said

1346
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,300
feed feed feed

1347
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,000
why because it

1348
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,940
is of tremendous

1349
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,040
importance does it

1350
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,820
do any good oh

1351
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,580
it's not only

1352
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,760
because the holy

1353
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,720
spirit works through

1354
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,580
it brings men to

1355
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,420
a conviction of

1356
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,180
sin and to a need

1357
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,540
of a savior it

1358
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,620
not only brings us

1359
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,500
to a living faith

1360
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,420
in Christ and to

1361
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,380
forgiveness life and

1362
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,900
salvation but through

1363
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,020
the word of God the

1364
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,280
holy spirit causes you

1365
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,960
and me to grow to

1366
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,800

Christian desire long

1388
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,460
for the milk of the

1389
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,120
word be fed he said

1390
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,260
that's why it's called

1391
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,740
this Sunday because

1392
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,860
we've got to grow

1393
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,540
wouldn't it be

1394
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,380
horrible if we didn't

1395
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,200
grow physically yet

1396
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,120
isn't it strange that

1397
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,360
some of us think

1398
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,160
nothing of it if we

1399
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
do not grow spiritually

1400
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,520
when the word of

1401
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,920
God is taught and

1402
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,980
when it is preached

1403
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,760
and when it is

1404
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,680
proclaimed and we

1405
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,140
are fed the holy

1406
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,460
spirit again causes

1407
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,580
us to grow we grow

1408
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,620
in the capacity of

1409
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,360
understanding we grow

1410
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,520
again in knowing what

1411
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,320
is right and wrong

1412
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
the conscience becomes

1413
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,360
very very sharp that

1414
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,520
we understand right

1415
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,260
and wrong as we

1416
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,220
never understood it

1417
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,620
and it shows in your

1418
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,940
life and mine because

1419
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,120
we are walking with

1420
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,300
him we have become more

1421
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,440
christ-like and thus

1422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,620
again as we grow

1423
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,080
through being fed the

1424
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
word of God lambs and

1425
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,420
sheep in the entire

1426
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,720
flock we grow strong

1427
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,300
against temptation so

1428
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,440
that we can keep our

1429
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,980
faith to the very day

1430
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,840
of our death we've got

1431
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,300
to have it on the day

1432
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,560
of our death and the

1433
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,940
temptations of life

1434
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,120
come Jesus told Peter

1435
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,900
Peter if you love me go

1436
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,280
out and feed the lambs

1437
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,860
feed the sheep feed the

1438
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,820
flock get out and

1439
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,860
teach does it do any

1440
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,280
good it's the means

1441
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,260
whereby the holy

1442
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,000
spirit strengthens you

1443
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,060
and me that we can be

1444
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,200
faithful to the very

1445
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
day when we shall stand

1446
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,320
on the very day of our

1447
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,660
death before our God

1448
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,000
and if again the chief

1449
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
concern of Jesus Christ

1450
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,160
on that day up at the

1451
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,320
sea of Galilee when he

1452
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,220
reinstated Peter into the

1453
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,100
apostolate if the chief

1454
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,220
concern of that risen

1455
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,560
Christ was this the

1456
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,340
feed then again if that

1457
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,600
is the chief concern of

1458
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,540
our life and our home we

1459
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,420
can look forward to

1460
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,480
anything that may come

1461
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
in life it was a rather

1462
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,560
sad day up there as you

1463
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,720
and I stand and listen

1464
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,200
when Jesus had reinstated

1465
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,840
him he looked at him and

1466
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,900
he said Peter when you

1467
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,520
were young he said you

1468
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
girded yourself you

1469
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,540
dressed yourself and you

1470
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,420
went wherever you wanted

1471
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
to go but he said Peter

1472
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,840
when you become old Peter

1473
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,660
was about 35 about that

1474
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,320
time he said Peter when

1475
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,560
you become old he said

1476
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,300
you're going to reach out

1477
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,420
your hands and another

1478
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,860
is going to tie you and

1479
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,840
another will take you

1480
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
where you don't want to

1481
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,580
go and John who was

1482
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,560
writing these words he

1483
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,340
wrote about the year

1484
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,380
19 this had already

1485
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,020
taken place John was

1486
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,160
telling us Jesus said

1487
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,860
this to indicate by what

1488
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,080
way he should die and

1489
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,700
glorify God you see Peter

1490
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,260
died a martyr's death he

1491
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,040
lived to see the day when

1492
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,440
somebody did tie his

1493
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,620
hands and they did lead

1494
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,440
him where he didn't

1495
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,800
want to go oh you

1496
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,020
remember the story when

1497
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,120
persecution had broken

1498
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,280
out and tradition says

1499
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,620
that Peter was fleeing

1500
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,740
Rome going down the

1501
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,900
Appian way friends had

1502
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,760
told him to save his

1503
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,100
life and as he was

1504
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
fleeing the city of

1505
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
Rome he saw somebody

1506
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,680
coming again he didn't

1507
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,980
quite recognize him

1508
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,560
and as he came closer

1509
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,540
he saw that it was the

1510
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,020
Lord and he said to

1511
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,860
him quo bodies

1512
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
domine whither goest

1513
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,980
thou Lord and Jesus

1514
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,360
supposedly said to him

1515
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,540
I'm going back to Rome

1516
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,700
to be crucified again

1517
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,740
and Peter this time he

1518
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,400
didn't defect tradition

1519
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,700
says he turned around

1520
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,680
and walked back the

1521
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,340
Appian way and came

1522
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,320
into the city of Rome

1523
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,120
and he was crucified

1524
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,940
this time he said oh

1525
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,380
don't crucify me like my

1526
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,280
Lord with my head up

1527
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,900
crucify me upside down

1528
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,680
so they drove the nails

1529
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,520
into his feet up and

1530
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,860
his head down into his

1531
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,780
arms and he was

1532
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,160
crucified so tradition

1533
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,540
says upside down for

1534
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,800
his Lord the man that

1535
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
was reinstated and the

1536
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,400
man that went out and

1537
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,120
he fed the flock and

1538
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,400
he fed them and he

1539
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,860
fed them when you and

1540
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,440
I have been fed and

1541
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,580
faith has grown it

1542
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,720
matters not what shall

1543
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,340
come we shall have

1544
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,420
this joy that when

1545
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,920
Christ shall return at

1546
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,880
the end of time you

1547
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,460
and I and our very

1548
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,540
bodies will see him

1549
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,720
face to face and he

1550
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,880
will know us and we

1551
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,800
shall know him I

1552
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,060
think of old Job of

1553
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,920
old when again Job

1554
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
was able to say I

1555
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,240
know that my Redeemer

1556
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,360
liveth and that at

1557
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,240
the latter day he

1558
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,600
shall stand upon this

1559
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,460
earth and though

1560
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,200
after my skin worms

1561
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,280
destroy this body yet

1562
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
in my flesh shall I

1563
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,260
see God and Job

1564
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,120
said I know my

1565
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,860
Redeemer lives and I

1566
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,800
know my body when it

1567
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,580
goes down to earth

1568
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,560
will be eaten up by

1569
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,760
worms but I know that

1570
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
at the last day my

1571
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,820
risen Lord's coming

1572
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,020
again and he will

1573
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,480
raise up my body from

1574
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,900
the grave and I

1575
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,600
know that in my body

1576
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,540
I shall see him

1577
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,060
when you and I

1578
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,580
thank God have been

1579
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,020
taught and we have

1580
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,440
been trained and

1581
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,100
instructed and

1582
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,600
nourished then we can

1583
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,580
look forward to the

1584
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,380
worst that the world

1585
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,640
can give but knowing

1586
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,820
again that a faith is

1587
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,620
grown and that the

1588
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,680
Holy Spirit still

1589
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,500
operates through the

1590
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,300
word of God we can

1591
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,480
stand and know that

1592
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,620
when he comes again

1593
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,280
what a joy will be

1594
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,460
ours with our own

1595
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,680
bodies raised from the

1596
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,700
dead we shall see him

1597
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,920
because we know that

1598
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,320
our Redeemer lives

1599
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,840
it's nice to stand

1600
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,780
every once in a while

1601
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,900
on the Sea of Galilee

1602
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,540
and to see the risen

1603
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,420
Christ as he reinstated

1604
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,380
Peter who had

1605
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,760
defected the ranks and

1606
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,720
to know where he put

1607
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,620
the emphasis he said

1608
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,260
Peter go out and feed

1609
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,140
feed feed feed the

1610
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,860

sheep feed the

1612
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,540
flock God grant you

1613
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,500
and me that we may

1614
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,480
consider the prime

1615
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,660
importance in our

1616
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,800
home because it's

1617
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,820
through being fed

1618
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,800
that you and I know

1619
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,340
him and that he

1620
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,180
shall know us at the

1621
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,380
latter day when we

1622
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,600
shall stand before

1623
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
him and oh God to

1624
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,820

1627
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,880
which passeth all

1628
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,060

1630
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
hearts and minds in

1631
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,900
