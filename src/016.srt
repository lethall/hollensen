1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,860
Peace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,240
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in the Old Testament in the book of Esther,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,020
the fourth chapter, the fourteenth verse.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,240
And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,940
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight,

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,280
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,500
In Christ Jesus, our Lord and our Savior, dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,780
you who are the listeners of our radio audience,

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,220
and especially you, the forty-three young men and women,

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,520
the high school graduates of our church and of our Sunday school.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
This is your baccalaureate service.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,280
You have come, young friends, to God's house this morning

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,900
in order to hear a message from the word of God

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,400
as you say farewell to your high school days

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,700
and as you take a look at your future.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,080
I wonder how many of you have spent long moments in the last several weeks

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,160
on this perplexing question.

18
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,880
Does God really guide my life?

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,040
Does God really lead me?

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,760
Does God really direct me?

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,820
Or is God the kind of a God who allows me to flounder as best I can,

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,300
to grope as a blind man and to feel my way along in life?

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,800
Does God really lead me?

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,740
Where is the guidance of God

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,000
that I can have some assurance that my life can be beautiful,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
that it can be worthwhile,

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,840
and that it can be most satisfying?

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,180
How many of you have spent many an hour

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,940
on that question?

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,020
Does God guide you

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,120
as high school days are over

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
and you are now looking to the future?

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,120
I would like to, at this baccalaureate service,

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
assure you, young men and women,

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,900
that God does lead you,

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,300
that God is hopelessly and gloriously concerned in your life,

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,140
that he leads you every inch of the way

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,200
and that your life can be beautiful.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,060
It can be most satisfying and most complete,

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,940
that God never for a moment allows you to flounder

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,640
and to grope in the darkness,

42
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,260
trying to feel your way,

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,620
wondering where to go.

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,240
And I would like to impress that truth on your minds

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,980
by calling to your attention an incident

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,700
that happened in the Old Testament

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,320
about 500 years before Jesus came into human history.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,100
It was back at the time after the children of Israel,

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,280
the southern kingdom had been destroyed

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,420
and Nebuchadnezzar had taken them in the year 586 B.C.

51
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,480
into captivity down in Babylon.

52
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,180
Then, you know, the Babylonian Empire fell

53
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,440
and the Medes and the Persians came to power

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,820
and the man on the throne was the Persian king

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,520
called Ahasuerus or Xerxes.

56
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,540
One night, as he was giving a party there in Persia

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,440
and they were drunken with wine,

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,420
he ordered that his wife Vashti

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,440
should come and display herself

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,160
before a group of drunken men.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,000
She refused to do so

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,780
and so he banished her as queen.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,300
And so then his portuers went out

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,780
into the land of Persia

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,140
to find someone who would take the place of Vashti

66
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,100
who would be the queen of Persia.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,780
And they found a very beautiful little girl.

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,140
She was a Jewess and her name was Esther,

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,860
which means star.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,260
Her Hebrew name was Hadessa,

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,900
which means Stella.

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,660
This little star, little Estrelita,

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,060
because of her beauty,

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,160
she was brought to Susa

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,660
and the king picked her as his queen.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,980
He did not know, however,

77
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,360
that she was a Jewess.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,980
That information was kept from her.

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,760
The man who stood next to the king

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
was a man by the name of Haman.

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
We would call him the prime minister.

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,620
And because Esther had been an orphan child

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,820
and had been reared by an older cousin

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,560
who had adopted her

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,300
and he became her guardian,

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,480
this man Mordecai was his name.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
He stayed near the palace

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,700
that he might communicate with Esther

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,920
who was now the queen of Persia.

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,280
And because this man Mordecai

91
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,220
again realized that being a Jew,

92
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,920
he would bow to no man,

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,280
Haman the prime minister hated him

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,860
because Haman thought that he was a god

95
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,660
and he wanted everybody to do obeisance to him.

96
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,480
But Mordecai refused.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,740
And so Haman planned

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,660
that he was going to kill Mordecai

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,640
and more than that,

100
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,640
he was going to exterminate

101
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
the entire Jewish race.

102
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,600
There was going to be genocide.

103
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,760
And by duping the king,

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,840
he had the king sign an edict

105
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,380
that on a certain day in Persia,

106
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,400
the Persians would rise up

107
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,580
and they would kill these alien people.

108
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,300
That every Jew would be exterminated.

109
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,880
And of course,

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,980
that would mean also Queen Esther herself.

111
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,780
And then it was that Mordecai,

112
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,260
in communicating to Esther,

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,080
told her,

114
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,900
he said,

115
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,620
Esther, you must do something.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,020
The fate of our people depends upon you.

117
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,360
And then he spoke the words of this text.

118
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,800
He says,

119
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,400
Who knows, Esther,

120
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,920
whether thou art come to the kingdom

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,360
for such a time as this.

122
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,620
How do you know

123
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,860
but what God has led you, Esther,

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,640
that he has guided you,

125
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,200
a little Jewish girl,

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,260
to become the queen of Persia

127
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,720
for such a crisis

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,560
when your entire race is at stake?

129
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,100
God guided Esther.

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
And may I assure you,

131
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060
when you have asked yourself the question,

132
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,500
Does God lead me?

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,840
Does God guide me?

134
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,400
Does God have anything to do

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
with choices in my life?

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,580
I want to assure you that God has.

137
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,040
He is hopelessly involved in your life.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,580
God leads and guides

139
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,340
who are not left to flounder alone.

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,300
And you may say,

141
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,480
But it's hard to see.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
I see no evidence of God in my life.

143
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,440
You may look and you say,

144
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,640
The events of my life,

145
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,460
they're ordinary.

146
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,560
They're commonplace.

147
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,120
They're trite.

148
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,980
They're rather trivial.

149
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,660
I fail to see the hand of God.

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,140
I'd like for these moments this morning

151
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,720
as we are here in God's house,

152
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,440
I would like to show you

153
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,980
on the basis of Esther

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,660
that God does lead and direct your life.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,060
And that if you will look

156
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,100
with the eye of faith

157
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,600
on those little inconsequential events

158
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,320
in your life,

159
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,960
you will see that God

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,140
is hopelessly and gloriously involved

161
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,060
in your life every inch of the way

162
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,860
and every day

163
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,020
that you aren't left to flounder alone.

164
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
In the first place,

165
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,380
I would remind you of this,

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,780
that perhaps again,

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
God is leading you

168
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,540
for such a day as this,

169
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
even as he led Esther,

170
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,880
that in the first place,

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,140
God has led you

172
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,560
to be born in this era,

173
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,880
and he has led you

174
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,220
to know Jesus Christ.

175
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,880
Don't you think Esther

176
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,020
thought many a time,

177
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,600
I wonder why I was born

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,100
an alien down in Persia

179
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,560
instead of over in Palestine

180
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,380
where my people had come from.

181
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,380
Don't you imagine

182
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,500
that Esther wondered at times,

183
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,940
why have my parents died?

184
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Why am I an orphan?

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
Why was I born with the beauty

186
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,360
that I have been born with?

187
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,760
How does it come

188
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,960
that I was born in this age?

189
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,600
You know,

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,760
when I was in Egypt

191
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,260
down in, again,

192
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,780
Luxor,

193
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,140
450 miles south of Cairo,

194
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,980
and I saw the great temple

195
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,220
of Ramses II,

196
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,460
and I realized

197
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,780
the heathenism of Egypt

198
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,720
back 2,000 years before Christ,

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,200
you know,

200
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,480
the thought came to my mind,

201
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,900
I wonder how it was like

202
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,860
to have been born then,

203
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,640
and I said to myself,

204
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,120
I wonder why I wasn't born then,

205
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,440
when I saw again

206
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,560
the pyramids in Egypt,

207
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,540
again the pyramids of Sheops,

208
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,840
and I said again to myself,

209
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,680
I wonder why I was born

210
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,700
in the 20th century,

211
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,680
not back there

212
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,580
2,000 years before Christ,

213
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,260
when I stood in the cave

214
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,960
of the bulls,

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,740
when the Egyptians

216
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,120
worshipped the sacred bull,

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,980
and again,

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,280
steeped in heathenism,

219
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
I thought to myself,

220
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,040
I wonder why I was born now,

221
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,600
and not back there,

222
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,380
did you ever wonder

223
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,100
why you were born

224
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,020
in the 20th century?

225
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,460
God moves in a mysterious way,

226
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,380
we have just sung,

227
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,880
haven't we?

228
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,780
But again,

229
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,840
God must direct your life,

230
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,460
because you were born now,

231
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,060
not 2,000 years ago,

232
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,540
why were you born

233
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,200
into the home

234
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,180
that you were born in?

235
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,340
How does it come,

236
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,460
you have the father and mother

237
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,060
that you have,

238
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,700
not somebody else's father and mother?

239
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,780
Does God guide you

240
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
in this era?

241
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,860
Most assuredly,

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,320
he does,

243
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,840
even as he was guiding Esther,

244
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
and above all,

245
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,720
in this guidance,

246
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,340
God guided you

247
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,000
to know Jesus Christ.

248
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,420
Many of you were seated here

249
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,160
on Palm Sunday

250
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
four years ago,

251
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,480
weren't you?

252
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,520
After again,

253
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,660
your days of catechism,

254
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,500
when you were led

255
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,280
by your parents

256
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
to know Jesus Christ

257
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,340
as Lord and Savior,

258
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,640
you heard the story

259
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,420
of God's Son

260
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,540
who came into this world,

261
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,960
and became a human being,

262
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,820
and went to Calvary

263
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,680
and suffered and died

264
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,740
for the sins of the world,

265
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,480
when he gave a complete atonement

266
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,000
for sins,

267
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,880
and that in him,

268
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,160
through trust in him,

269
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,920
there is forgiveness,

270
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,040
life, and salvation.

271
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,460
You came to know him

272
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
as Lord,

273
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,920
and you may say,

274
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
what is the guidance of God?

275
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,740
Where is his leading?

276
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,700
Does God care about my life?

277
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,980
Is his hand

278
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,660
in the shaping

279
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,000
of my human days

280
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,180
from day to day?

281
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
And my answer is yes,

282
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,180
unequivocally.

283
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,300
God is hopelessly involved

284
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,080
in your life.

285
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,600
You again have been led

286
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
to Jesus Christ,

287
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:49,920
and therefore,

288
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,420
God still guides you

289
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,280
in the ways of right,

290
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,400
so that in the ways of right

291
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,620
in which you are to walk

292
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,120
in the future,

293
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,300
you may not lose

294
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,880
that life and salvation

295
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,180
which is yours in him.

296
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,220
Ours is an amazing God,

297
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
young friends.

298
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,380
The matter of right and wrong

299
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,660
is something that is absolute

300
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,420
in his sight.

301
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,420
Right is not something relative

302
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,880
that it changes today,

303
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,440
and that what is right today

304
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
is wrong tomorrow,

305
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,940
or that what is wrong now,

306
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,540
50 years,

307
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,780
may be right not at all.

308
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
The rightness of God,

309
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,860
because God is immutable

310
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,040
and he is changeless,

311
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,720
that rightness stands

312
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
throughout time

313
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,260
and it stands

314
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,300
throughout all eternity.

315
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,120
What is right

316
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,980
is always right

317
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,800
in the sight of God.

318
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,820
What is wrong

319
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,340
is always desperately wrong.

320
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
And as God guides you

321
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,140
from day to day

322
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,400
on the basis of the knowledge

323
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,420
that you have of him,

324
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,260
guiding you in the ways

325
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,740
of right,

326
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,880
God guides you

327
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
every inch of the way,

328
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,520
calling upon you

329
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,460
at all times,

330
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
do that which is right,

331
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,240
lest you lose

332
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,180
Jesus Christ.

333
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,540
God is hopelessly

334
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,420
and gloriously

335
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,060
involved in your life.

336
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,420
He does lead you,

337
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,700
he guides you,

338
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,460
even as he was guiding

339
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Esther,

340
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
little Esther,

341
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,580
elite 500 years

342
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,700
before Jesus came

343
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,280
to the world.

344
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,580
And that's why today

345
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,560
I would say to you,

346
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,980
I hope that you go out

347
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,840
of church this morning

348
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,860
believing this,

349
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,140
that God has his finger

350
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,900
in your life.

351
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,580
I want you to go out

352
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,740
with this assurance,

353
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
regardless of anything,

354
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,800
that God leads

355
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
and God guides.

356
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,740
If you will go out

357
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,800
of church with that conviction

358
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,260
this morning,

359
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,020
then I know this,

360
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
you'll have daily contact

361
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,240
with him.

362
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
I want to be very honest

363
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,920
and frank with you,

364
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,460
you will never be seated

365
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,640
of course like this again

366
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,260
in this church,

367
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,560
will you?

368
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,220
This is it.

369
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,580
And another thing,

370
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,460
if there's ever a loss

371
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,940
in the church,

372
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,200
it's after this Sunday.

373
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,720
Rather strange,

374
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,220
isn't it?

375
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,060
But why is it that some say,

376
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,860
I've gone to church

377
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,640
all my life

378
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,580
and this is the end,

379
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,660
the apron strings are cut,

380
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm going to live my own life.

381
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
I know my parents

382
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
have brought me to church,

383
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,300
but I'm going to find out

384
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,580
what it is not to go to church.

385
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,640
There isn't anybody

386
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,420
that can stop you,

387
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,000
isn't that right?

388
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,040
From now on,

389
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,660
you're on your own.

390
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,480
I know you're 18,

391
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,340
you're not 21,

392
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,420
but you're on your own.

393
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,200
The great drop

394
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,620
in the church comes now.

395
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,500
Be very honest with you

396
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,340
and reckoned with you,

397
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,900
that's when the dip comes.

398
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,860
If we're going to lose you,

399
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,520
we're going to lose you

400
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,220
after high school.

401
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,620
Because again,

402
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,460
you can say,

403
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,440
I can live my life

404
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,980
as I please,

405
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,920
I'll do as I please,

406
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,620
I don't have to obey my parents,

407
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't have to do anything

408
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,220
but what I want to do.

409
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,920
But if you can go out

410
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,760
of church this morning

411
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,520
knowing this,

412
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,060
that God does lead your life

413
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,580
and he does direct that life

414
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,500
and God is hopelessly involved

415
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,580
and gloriously so,

416
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,440
you will have daily contact.

417
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,200
You'll keep it up

418
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,940
and you'll go to church

419
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,740
and you'll hear the word.

420
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,640
And again,

421
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
Jesus Christ will still live

422
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,680
in your hearts.

423
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,600
Here was again

424
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,060
a man by the name of Haman

425
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,000
who was threatening

426
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,060
the extinction

427
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,820
of an entire race

428
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,340
of people,

429
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,820
the Jew.

430
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,400
May I say,

431
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,820
that happened 500 years

432
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,500
before Christ,

433
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,260
but don't forget,

434
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,960
it also happened

435
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,780
in our day too.

436
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,900
Don't forget Adolf Hitler.

437
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,660
This thing of genocide

438
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,160
was tried in his day.

439
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,100
Yes,

440
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,400
when he wandered away

441
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,020
from God

442
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,240
and that which was right,

443
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,000
when a man does that,

444
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,760
a man is a dangerous man

445
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
and six million Jews,

446
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
don't forget,

447
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,900
went into the gas chambers

448
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,620
of Buchendalt and Dachau.

449
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,060
Human beings

450
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,020
created in the image

451
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,620
of God,

452
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,260
gassed

453
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,120
because a man

454
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,400
tried to exterminate

455
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
the Jewish race

456
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,620
just like Haman did of old.

457
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,640
You have no idea

458
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,580
what a potential

459
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,980
you have for wickedness

460
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,360
without Jesus Christ.

461
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,560
A painter tells the story

462
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,820
that he wanted to paint Jesus

463
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,080
and all the twelve disciples.

464
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,140
He started with Jesus.

465
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,200
It was a number of years later

466
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,340
that he wanted to get a man

467
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,280
to typify Judas.

468
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,280
And he went out again

469
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,300
to the lower sections

470
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,060
of the town,

471
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,900
to the underworld,

472
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,700
and he picked a man

473
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,280
that looked to him

474
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,960
just like Judas.

475
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,340
When he was painting him

476
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,840
one day,

477
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,420
the man that he was painting

478
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,600
as Judas looked at him

479
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:45,920
and he says,

480
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,060
I was the man

481
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,180
that you used years ago

482
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,120
to be the Christ.

483
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,160
It's not a very long way

484
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,020
from being a Christian

485
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,780
to being a Hitler

486
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,980
who would exterminate

487
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,100
an entire race of people.

488
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,340
You do not know

489
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,440
what you can do

490
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,820
when you forget

491
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,940
that God guides you.

492
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,740
And that's why

493
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
speaking to you

494
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,760
face to face

495
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
and heart to heart,

496
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,640
I hope that when you go

497
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,300
out of this church

498
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,800
this morning,

499
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,740
you have the assurance

500
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,800
that God does lead,

501
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,580
He does guide.

502
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,060
And God is hopelessly

503
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,080
concerned in your life

504
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,160
that you're going to say,

505
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,480
therefore I'm going to live close.

506
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,500
And I'm not going to forget Him

507
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,920
because who knows

508
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,540
the potential

509
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,660
of evil

510
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,260
that can come

511
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,120
in any man's life

512
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,360
without Jesus Christ.

513
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,500
You may say,

514
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,880
well,

515
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,080
my life is,

516
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,280
oh,

517
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
it's inconsequential.

518
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,280
The events of my life,

519
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,700
there's nothing extraordinary.

520
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,760
There's nothing great

521
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,440
or pretentious.

522
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
I fail to see

523
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,020
the evidence

524
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,260
that God has something

525
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
to do in the guidance

526
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,300
of my life.

527
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,980
And I want to assure you

528
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,620
that He does.

529
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,740
Just as again,

530
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,620
Mordecai said to Esther,

531
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,600
who knoweth

532
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
whether thou art not

533
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
come to the kingdom

534
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,700
for such a time as this?

535
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,080
God's leading you

536
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,540
for such a crisis.

537
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,860
God leads you.

538
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,600
Don't you ever forget it.

539
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,180
He guides you.

540
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,560
He is hopelessly

541
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,880
involved in your life.

542
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,540
Because in the second place,

543
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,700
I want to assure you this,

544
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,800
that God, again,

545
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,280
has led you to be endowed

546
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,460
in a most unique

547
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,640
and singular way.

548
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,400
Have you ever realized,

549
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,300
and I know you have,

550
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,380
just how different you are

551
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,780
from the man sitting

552
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,480
alongside you

553
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,920
with the girls?

554
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
You've seen it in school,

555
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,280
haven't you?

556
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,960
Why is it that you look

557
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,640
at some and you say,

558
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,340
oh, I wish I had

559
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,320
that guy's brain?

560
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,360
Maybe you've looked

561
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,080
at some of these girls

562
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,300
and said,

563
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,620
I wish that I had

564
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,720
her ability and talent.

565
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,720
Isn't it strange?

566
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,540
You've noticed

567
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,120
a difference,

568
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,660
haven't you?

569
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,740
Maybe you've gone

570
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,460
into an inferiority complex.

571
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,860
You know,

572
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,700
it's easy to do,

573
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,140
isn't it?

574
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,180
When I turn over

575
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,960
a radio set

576
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,660
or look at the back

577
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,040
of it and see

578
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,740
all those wires,

579
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,900
I get weak all over.

580
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,420
Because to me,

581
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,280
it's a maze

582
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't understand it.

583
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm doing good

584
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,200
with a television set

585
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,300
to get the picture

586
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,940
in focus.

587
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,380
I don't know

588
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,000
what it'd ever do

589
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,920
if something was wrong.

590
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,220
If an automobile

591
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,440
to run had to depend

592
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,300
upon my fiction

593
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,500
it,

594
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,440
it would never run.

595
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,680
Now,

596
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,200
shall you get

597
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,720
a very feeling

598
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,860
of inferiority?

599
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:55,940
No,

600
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,300
again,

601
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,280
there are some things

602
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,820
we can do

603
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,620
and there are some things

604
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,220
we can't do.

605
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,020
There was Esther.

606
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,420
Again,

607
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,820
uniquely situated

608
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,680
and endowed.

609
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,360
She was a beautiful girl.

610
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,140
But oh,

611
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,840
what quality

612
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,360
she must have had

613
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
when finally

614
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,600
Mordecai told her,

615
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:11,860
he says,

616
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,120
your race depends

617
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,980
upon you,

618
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,440
Esther.

619
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,820
You've got to go

620
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,660
into the king

621
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,640
and you've got

622
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,280
to tell him

623
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,240
that he's been duked,

624
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,140
that he signed

625
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,980
a death warrant

626
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,800
for our nation.

627
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,020
You've got to tell him

628
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,740
you're a Jewess

629
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,900
and you've got to tell him

630
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,680
that on a certain day

631
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,160
we're all going

632
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,660
to be killed.

633
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,500
Well,

634
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:27,740
again,

635
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,380
if you understand

636
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,800
the rule of the Persians,

637
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,280
no one dare walk

638
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,920
into the presence

639
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,460
of the king

640
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,100
without first

641
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,880
having been summoned

642
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,340
and it was punishable

643
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,020
by death.

644
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,380
But Esther was

645
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,520
a clever woman

646
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,240
to be sure.

647
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,520
She was a wise

648
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,620
and a person

649
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,360
as a serpent

650
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,000
and harmless

651
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,560
as a dove.

652
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,320
She used to actually

653
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
dressed up beautifully

654
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,900
that day

655
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,860
and again,

656
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,660
then she was going

657
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,340
to walk in

658
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,120
on her husband.

659
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
She hadn't seen him

660
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,680
for months.

661
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Walked in on him

662
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,540
unannounced

663
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,480
and if he would hold up

664
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,520
the golden scepter,

665
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,780
that would mean

666
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,520
she could come in

667
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,120
and if he didn't

668
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,620
hold it up

669
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,320
it means she would

670
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
be taken out

671
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,360
and killed.

672
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,400
And she said

673
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,040
to Mordecai,

674
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,400
I go and if I perish,

675
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,120
I perish.

676
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,300
And again,

677
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,820
with a prayer

678
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,320
on her lips,

679
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,840
she walked

680
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
into the presence

681
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,220
of her husband,

682
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,180
the king of Persia.

683
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,420
She looked

684
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,880
and she wondered

685
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,400
what he was going

686
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,660
to do.

687
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,340
When he saw her,

688
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,900
he looked up

689
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,840
the golden scepter

690
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,420
and he held it

691
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,120
out to her

692
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,620
and she walked up

693
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,500
and she touched it

694
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,300
and she bowed

695
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,960
before him

696
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,360
and he said,

697
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,160
what do you want?

698
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,940
Then she told him,

699
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,280
she said,

700
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,780
I want to give

701
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,820
a banquet for you

702
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,840
and for him

703
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,740
and the prime minister

704
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,540
and the king said,

705
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:25,920
all right.

706
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,720
So they had a meal

707
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,300
that day.

708
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,400
Then the king said,

709
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,380
what is on your heart?

710
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,820
And she says,

711
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,760
I'll give another banquet

712
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,540
for you two tomorrow

713
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,220
and I'll tell you.

714
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,340
The next day,

715
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,140
the king and Haman

716
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,680
were together

717
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,400
and there was Esther

718
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,620
and finally she stood up.

719
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,620
Again,

720
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,280
little Esther Lita,

721
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
a little Jewish exile girl,

722
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,660
a little orphan.

723
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,980
And she stood up

724
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,040
before the king of Persia

725
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,500
and she said,

726
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,340
you have been duped,

727
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,820
oh king.

728
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,160
You have been duped

729
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,300
to sign the death warrant

730
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,160
for the nation of aliens

731
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,920
that live among you.

732
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,240
And she says,

733
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,460
I am a Jewess

734
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,880
and if this is carried out,

735
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,640
I shall be killed.

736
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,760
The king in rage

737
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,260
looked at her

738
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,540
and he said,

739
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,900
who caused me to do that?

740
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,360
And she says,

741
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,700
Haman,

742
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,260
you're high,

743
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:02,940
the gang,

744
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,780
you're prime minister.

745
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,720
And he had done it

746
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,340
and he had duped

747
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,880
and full enraged,

748
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,880
the king walked out

749
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,360
of the room

750
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,700
and Haman threw himself

751
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,420
on the couch

752
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,660
where Esther was lying.

753
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,160
When the king walked in,

754
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,400
he said,

755
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,340
would you even besmirch my wife?

756
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
And Haman had secretly

757
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,420
built a gallows

758
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,500
in his own yard

759
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,720
because he was going

760
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,660
to hang Mordecai

761
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,780
because Mordecai

762
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,740
wouldn't bow to him

763
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,280
and the king ordered Haman

764
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,160
to be hanged

765
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,820
on the gallows

766
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,500
that he prepared

767
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,040
for another.

768
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
And because in the laws

769
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
of the Persians,

770
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,140
no law could be rescinded,

771
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,320
the king issued

772
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,080
another redict

773
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,460
and he says,

774
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,100
you Jews may defend yourselves.

775
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,960
When the day came,

776
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,620
the Jews defended themselves

777
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,540
and 75,000 Persians

778
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,100
were killed.

779
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,420
But they were not exterminated

780
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,740
because of the heroism

781
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,040
of Esther.

782
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,840
Of Esther who again

783
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,340
had been endowed by God

784
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,600
and God led her

785
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,640
through again

786
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,180
the circumstances of life

787
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,320
to fulfill her mission.

788
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,200
I hope you go out

789
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,380
of church this morning

790
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,060
with this conviction,

791
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,860
young friends,

792
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,400
that God does lead you,

793
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,620
he guides you,

794
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,000
and he directs you

795
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,780
that your life

796
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,880
can be beautiful

797
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,420
and it can be worthwhile

798
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,940
and it can be satisfying.

799
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,340
And if you can go out

800
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,740
with that conviction again

801
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,280
as God through circumstances

802
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,580
will lead you

803
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,300
to find your niche

804
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,540
and your mission in life,

805
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760
then you're going to submit to it

806
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,540
when God calls you

807
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,740
and leads you

808
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
to see your responsibilities.

809
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,480
Some of you may say,

810
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:28,900
well I don't know

811
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,840
what I'm going to do.

812
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,160
I'm worried.

813
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,240
I don't know what I want to do.

814
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,960
The answer doesn't come.

815
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Does God guide me?

816
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,780
Will God guide me

817
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,660
and lead me

818
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,340
to my mission in life?

819
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,300
And my answer is yes.

820
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,120
If you will watch

821
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,060
the opportunities

822
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,980
and the circumstances of life.

823
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,520
If you'll pardon

824
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,700
my own illustration in life,

825
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,300
I'd like to tell you my story.

826
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,900
When I entered

827
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,480
Capitol University,

828
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,260
I wasn't certain

829
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,300
that I was going to be a minister.

830
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
I was hovering

831
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,320
between ministry of medicine,

832
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,220
one or the other.

833
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,940
I wasn't sure.

834
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,760
When I returned

835
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,360
to Capitol University

836
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,040
in my sophomore year in college,

837
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,740
it so happened

838
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,840
that I had discovered

839
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,220
that I had a large stone

840
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,980
in my kidney.

841
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,520
I was not in good shape.

842
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,520
I lasted out the year

843
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,540
and I remember

844
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,020
taking my final examination

845
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,620
just a young lad,

846
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,780
19 years old.

847
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,620
Took the final examination

848
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,420
and that stone

849
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
started to act up

850
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,140
and I was a pretty

851
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,940
miserable person.

852
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
I took the first train

853
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,580
to St. Louis

854
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,380
that I could get out.

855
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,040
I didn't want to be sick

856
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,440
in Columbus.

857
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,420
I called my urologist

858
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,160
and I told him

859
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,380
that something was wrong.

860
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
And the first time

861
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,380
I got to see him,

862
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
I'll never forget

863
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,240
when I was being examined

864
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,680
by him,

865
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,340
he looked at me

866
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,680
and he said,

867
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,120
how long has this been going on?

868
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,780
And I told him

869
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,920
and when he looked at me

870
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,420
and he said,

871
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,760
I hope you don't lose a kidney.

872
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,080
I know what it means

873
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,900
to lie on a hospital bed alone,

874
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,320
19-year-old boy,

875
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,060
a lot of ambition

876
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,660
and wanting to do something

877
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,320
in life,

878
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,700
then being told

879
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,740
you might lose a kidney.

880
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,020
Life almost folded that day.

881
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,780
I wondered,

882
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,040
oh, to be a minister

883
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,060
to go through life

884
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,220
with just one kidney.

885
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,640
God and I had quite

886
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,380
a conversation that day

887
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,600
and I asked God

888
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,940
that if it were his will

889
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,100
that he'd save that kidney for me

890
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
that I was willing

891
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,540
to give him my life

892
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,240
to surrender it

893
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,140
and to be a minister

894
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,860
that I had in mind,

895
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,820
it seemed that God

896
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,580
was calling in that circumstance

897
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,140
like he had never called before.

898
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Well, the stone was removed,

899
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,780
the kidney was checked

900
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,860
and double-checked

901
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,940
as urologists do

902
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,880
and he came in

903
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,740
and he said to me,

904
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,940
your kidney isn't damaged at all.

905
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,640
You can be a healthy minister

906
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
and I say this

907
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,240
in the deepest sense

908
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,060
of humility

909
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,880
and appreciation.

910
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,140
This coming week,

911
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,840
it'll be 33 years

912
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,660
since I graduated

913
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,000
from the Capitol University Center.

914
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,720
I've been in the ministry

915
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,860
for 33 years

916
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,960
and I've never missed

917
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,940
one Sunday for illness

918
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,520
in 33 years.

919
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,660
I want you to know

920
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,220
that as far as I'm concerned

921
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
from the depth of my soul,

922
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,320
God does lead

923
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,160
and God does guide.

924
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,000
And as this church

925
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,680
has grown

926
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,220
to the largest

927
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,900
Lutheran church

928
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,960
in the Ohio district

929
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,480
of the American Lutheran Church,

930
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,700
believe you me,

931
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,600
the responsibilities

932
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,740
are tremendous.

933
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,620
But the health

934
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,800
that God has given

935
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,820
amazes me.

936
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,500
Don't you ever forget

937
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
God does lead

938
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,700
and guide

939
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,120
and direct you

940
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,580
and I ask you

941
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,360
when you see

942
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,900
his hand

943
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,540
accepted

944
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,380
and surrendered.

945
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,820
Yours will be

946
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,500
the joy

947
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,300
of fulfilling

948
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,240
your mission

949
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,980
and your mission

950
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,560
in life

951
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,500
and that's

952
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
the greatest joy.

953
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,280
Life can be beautiful,

954
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,900
it can be worth living.

955
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,240
There was Queen Esther

956
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,300
and you may say,

957
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,760
what am I going to do?

958
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,460
What does God want?

959
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,400
Do you look at the future?

960
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,740
Does God guide

961
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,300
and direct?

962
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,160
Does he care?

963
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,060
Don't I just flounder

964
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,020
as a blind man

965
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,000
groping my way

966
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,560
and just feel

967
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,180
my way along

968
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,640
and I don't know

969
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,220
what I'm supposed to do

970
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,300
and why I'm alive?

971
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,680
Listen,

972
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,220
I want you to know this

973
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,020
that from the depth

974
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,800
of my soul

975
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,200
I believe

976
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,420
God does lead

977
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,440
and he guides you

978
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,200
and he directs you.

979
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,340
He is hopelessly

980
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,140
and gloriously

981
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,220
involved in your life.

982
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,780
There's never a moment

983
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,480
of any day

984
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,820
that he doesn't guide you.

985
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,280
You may say,

986
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,420
well,

987
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,140
where's the evidence?

988
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,920
And I would mention

989
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,720
in the third place

990
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,100
is that God leads you

991
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,900
to love

992
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,160
and he leads you

993
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,820
to be loved,

994
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,560
doesn't he?

995
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,280
Love is a marvelous thing,

996
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,660
isn't it?

997
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:39,980
You may say,

998
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,000
who am I going to marry?

999
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,400
Talk about love again.

1000
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,420
God made us male

1001
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,940
and female,

1002
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,540
didn't he?

1003
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,220
Yes,

1004
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,720
sex was a beautiful thing.

1005
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,360
That's the way

1006
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,380
God made us.

1007
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,900
And yet love again

1008
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,000
was to use sex

1009
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,940
that it might be used

1010
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,820
to God's glory.

1011
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,620
I like to define love.

1012
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,260
Love is that

1013
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,980
which is left

1014
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,800
when sex

1015
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,000
has been satisfied.

1016
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,060
Isn't it strange

1017
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,020
that maybe some of you

1018
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,060
already have experienced

1019
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,320
that God has led you

1020
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,980
to love somebody else?

1021
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,180
It's a thrilling thing,

1022
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,660
isn't it?

1023
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,800
But you say,

1024
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,280
why do I love so and so?

1025
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,260
Somebody else may say to you,

1026
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,380
well,

1027
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,300
how can you love her?

1028
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,180
And they say to you,

1029
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,400
because how can you love him?

1030
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,240
And you say,

1031
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,160
but I do.

1032
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,480
And again,

1033
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
he may be homely again,

1034
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,000
all the things

1035
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,780
that may be wrong,

1036
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,800
but something about love

1037
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,660
to one person.

1038
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,520
And isn't it the joy of life

1039
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,440
to be loved,

1040
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,540
to know that somebody cares?

1041
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,300
As one man says,

1042
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
the joy of my life

1043
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,740
is this,

1044
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,920
to know that somebody cares

1045
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,700
whether I get home

1046
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,920
for supper on time.

1047
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,600
God does lead you.

1048
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,280
And may I assure you

1049
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,680
that when God leads you

1050
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,520
and guides you

1051
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,540
and guides you

1052
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,780
in this thing of love

1053
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,880
and you find someone

1054
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,200
that you'd love to live with

1055
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,060
and he with you

1056
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,340
and you can consummate it

1057
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,460
in matrimony,

1058
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,360
God will lead you.

1059
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,820
That life can be beautiful

1060
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,260
because,

1061
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,560
listen,

1062
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,240
your home,

1063
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,500
God would want it such.

1064
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,780
It ought to be

1065
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,180
a veritable foretaste

1066
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,780
of heaven.

1067
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,340
Bear in mind,

1068
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,440
it doesn't depend upon

1069
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,140
how much money

1070
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,840
you're going to make.

1071
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,900
It doesn't depend upon

1072
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,080
the name you make in life.

1073
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,840
But when God Almighty

1074
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,800
leads your life

1075
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
and directs it

1076
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,900
and he is hopelessly involved

1077
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,000
and gloriously so,

1078
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,080
God will lead your life

1079
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,700
that your home

1080
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,200
can be a bit of heaven

1081
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,820
on earth.

1082
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,700
And if it isn't,

1083
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,560
it's because you didn't

1084
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,860
let God guide you

1085
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
and you didn't let him

1086
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,480
lead you.

1087
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,360
There was little Esther,

1088
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:25,760
yes,

1089
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,200
the little Jewish girl

1090
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,260
and orphan girl

1091
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,240
and exile.

1092
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,880
She may have said

1093
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,780
to herself over

1094
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,580
and over again,

1095
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,200
and I,

1096
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,900
a little Jewish girl,

1097
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,540
should become the queen,

1098
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,660
the queen of the king

1099
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,500
of Persia.

1100
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,740
Oh, you know,

1101
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,420
about this man,

1102
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,260
Ahasuerus,

1103
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,080
he desperately loved her.

1104
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,740
He must have adored

1105
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,900
the ground she walked on.

1106
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,420
They were married

1107
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,300
for five years

1108
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,740
when she walked in that day

1109
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,980
and he held out

1110
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,940
the scepter to her.

1111
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,040
Again,

1112
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,840
there was something

1113
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,540
about her

1114
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,660
that he loved

1115
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,100
and as history goes on,

1116
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,620
again,

1117
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,320
he was followed

1118
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,160
by his son,

1119
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,140
her stepson,

1120
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,140
and that was,

1121
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,440
again,

1122
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,300
Artaxerxes

1123
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,280
and he was the man

1124
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
that sent Nehemiah

1125
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,480
over to rebuild Jerusalem

1126
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,280
and build the wall

1127
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,460
and to fortify the city.

1128
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,820
What a place

1129
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,880
Esther had

1130
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,480
in the plan of God.

1131
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,160
You may say,

1132
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,580
well,

1133
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,400
what did it mean

1134
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,360
that she was the one

1135
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,680
that saved the Jewish race

1136
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,540
from extermination?

1137
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,460
Young friends,

1138
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:19,980
don't forget

1139
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,800
Christ came from

1140
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,520
the Jewish race.

1141
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,140
What would have happened

1142
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,480
had on that day

1143
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,200
in Persia,

1144
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,320
had there been

1145
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,700
simply an extermination

1146
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,840
and over in Palestine

1147
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
because Persia ruled

1148
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,460
the world

1149
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,120
that every Jewish man

1150
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,500
and woman

1151
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:32,940
and child

1152
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,700
would have been killed.

1153
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,480
Jesus came from,

1154
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,120
again,

1155
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
the chosen people,

1156
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,660
the Jew.

1157
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,240
God used

1158
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,820
a little slave girl,

1159
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,740
Estrelita,

1160
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,420
and she saved the nation.

1161
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:46,960
And today,

1162
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,280
the Jew still celebrates

1163
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,200
the Feast of Purim.

1164
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
The word pure

1165
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,340
means,

1166
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,060
again,

1167
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,720
a lot.

1168
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,340
Heman cast a lot

1169
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,780
on the day

1170
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,320
when he was going

1171
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,460
to exterminate the Jew.

1172
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,900
And they celebrate

1173
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,040
the Feast of Purim,

1174
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,880
which commemorates

1175
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,360
the time

1176
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,280
when God used

1177
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,440
little Estrelita

1178
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,400
to save a nation

1179
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,580
that Christ came

1180
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,800
from the Jewish line,

1181
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,960
the Lord and Savior.

1182
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,700
I hope you go out

1183
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,740
of church this morning,

1184
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,540
high school friends,

1185
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,260
knowing this,

1186
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,180
that as you face

1187
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,900
the future,

1188
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,160
God does lead you.

1189
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,700
He does direct you.

1190
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,620
He guides you.

1191
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,960
He is hopelessly,

1192
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,520
gloriously involved

1193
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,140
in your life.

1194
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,340
And I hope you go out

1195
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,380
with grateful hearts

1196
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,840
that as you surrender

1197
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,340
to his will,

1198
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,420
you can thank God

1199
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,120
that he really is

1200
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,960
that much concerned

1201
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,600
about you.

1202
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,740
And I hope also

1203
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,720
that you will thank God

1204
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
that you live in a nation

1205
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,720
where you can allow

1206
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,400
God to lead

1207
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,980
and you can do

1208
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
as God leads.

1209
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,140
You realize what it means

1210
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,520
that America is

1211
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,280
our native land.

1212
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,160
Yesterday was Memorial Day

1213
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
when again we honored

1214
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,600
our soldier dead,

1215
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,420
the men and the women

1216
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,000
who have given

1217
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,640
of their lives

1218
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,260
that this nation

1219
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,020
could be free,

1220
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,040
that this nation

1221
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,700
of the people

1222
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,540
and by the people

1223
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,300
and for the people

1224
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,000
should not perish

1225
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,580
from the earth.

1226
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,680
Let me tell you,

1227
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,280
you've got to get out

1228
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,840
of this nation

1229
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,340
a little bit

1230
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,540
in order to appreciate it.

1231
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,040
When I was behind

1232
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,800
the Iron Curtain

1233
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,860
and in nations again

1234
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,940
where a man wasn't free,

1235
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,920
when I came back

1236
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,520
to America,

1237
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,700
I was ready

1238
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,220
to get down

1239
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,700
on my knees

1240
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,660
and kiss the ground.

1241
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,580
That's what it meant.

1242
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
You can't appreciate it

1243
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,480
until you get out of here.

1244
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,240
If you don't like

1245
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,740
this nation,

1246
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,600
this is the greatest

1247
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,260
under heaven,

1248
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,260
let me assure you.

1249
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,120
And as young citizens,

1250
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,540
listen,

1251
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,820
go out and know this,

1252
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,720
that in this land

1253
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,080
that it's so great

1254
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,020
and that's so marvelous

1255
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,800
that you can fulfill

1256
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,020
your mission in life

1257
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,060
and God can lead you

1258
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,100
and you can fulfill it.

1259
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,920
Then stand on tiptoe

1260
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,600
and wait and see

1261
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
what is in store for you.

1262
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,640
Last Friday night,

1263
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,260
you remember,

1264
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,780
President Johnson

1265
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,240
was down in his hometown

1266
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,300
in Texas

1267
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,040
and he gave the

1268
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
commencement address

1269
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,980
at the little high school

1270
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,060
from which he graduated.

1271
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:44,940
Do you remember

1272
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,760
the thing that he said

1273
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,580
over and over again?

1274
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,500
And he just,

1275
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,360
he was amazed.

1276
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,100
He said this

1277
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,400
in that speech

1278
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,660
before that small group.

1279
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,060
He said,

1280
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,980
40 years ago,

1281
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,840
I was graduated

1282
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,760
from this high school

1283
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
and he said,

1284
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,040
I just can't believe,

1285
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,340
I just can't believe

1286
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,740
that the path

1287
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,120
has led from this high school

1288
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,020
to the White House.

1289
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
You see what he was acknowledging,

1290
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,880
how God had directed

1291
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,200
and guided his life

1292
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,340
from that little high school

1293
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,000
in Texas

1294
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,540
to the White House

1295
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,460
to become President

1296
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,600
of the United States.

1297
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,680
Go out of church

1298
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,500
this morning

1299
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,780
and remember Esther,

1300
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,860
Estrelita,

1301
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,880
little star.

1302
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,060
Let her restore faith

1303
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,380
in you

1304
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,440
that God Almighty

1305
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,580
who runs the universe,

1306
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,420
he is hopelessly involved

1307
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,020
in your life.

1308
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,840
He leads you

1309
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,980
and he guides you

1310
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,820
as you go along

1311
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,580
the glory road.

1312
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,440
I hope that you surrender

1313
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,360
to your Lord

1314
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,120
and that you say,

1315
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,980
I'm going to let God guide

1316
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,600
and I'm going to walk

1317
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,740
with Jesus Christ.

1318
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,000
That you can sing

1319
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,840
on the glory road

1320
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,160
the hymn

1321
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,220
that you've sung so often,

1322
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,320
living for Jesus,

1323
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,300
a life that is true,

1324
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,780
striving to please him

1325
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,920
in all that I do,

1326
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,640
yielding allegiance,

1327
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,260
glad-hearted and free.

1328
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,220
This is the pathway

1329
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,620
of blessing for me.

1330
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,540
God bless you.

1331
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,620
Amen.

1332
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:00,720
Amen.

1333
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,820
The peace of God

1334
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,620
which passeth

1335
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,040
all human understanding,

1336
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,680
keep and unite

1337
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,820
your hearts and minds

1338
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,900
in Christ Jesus

1339
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,860
unto life everlasting.

1340
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,520
Thank you.

1341
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1342
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,100
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1343
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,320
thank you.

1344
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Thank you.

1345
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,820
Thank you.

1346
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,460
Thank you.

1347
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,020
Thank you.

1348
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,420
Thank you.

1349
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,200
Thank you.

1350
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,280
Thank you.

1351
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,320
Thank you.

1352
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,380
Thank you.

1353
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,620
Thank you.

1354
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:25,900
Thank you.

1355
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,360
Thank you.

1356
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,540
Thank you.

1357
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,360
