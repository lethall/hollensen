1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,480
Let us be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:17,880
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written in the gospel according to St. Matthew, the second chapter, verses 1 and 2.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,680
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king,

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,440
behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying,

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,220
Where is he that is born King of the Jews?

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,780
For we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,040
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,240
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer. Amen.

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,520
In Christ Jesus, the manger child of Bethlehem,

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,960
dear friends, you who are here in God's house this morning,

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,600
and you also Christian friends who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,600
Today we are celebrating the festival of Epiphany.

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,660
We are also taking note of the fact that this is the first Sunday of a new year.

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,720
The word Epiphany means a manifestation or a showing forth,

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,920
and this festival commemorates the manifestation of Jesus as the Savior to the wise men.

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,080
The festival of Epiphany is also called the Gentile Christmas

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,340
because the wise men were not Jews, they were non-Jews,

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,580
or as we call them, Gentiles.

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,020
The festival of Epiphany is also called the festival of the 12th day

20
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,840
because it always comes on January the 6th,

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,620
which would be Wednesday of this week,

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,340
12 days after the regular Christmas of December the 25th.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,600
Epiphany is the oldest festival in the Christian church,

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,020
for it was celebrated even before the Christmas of December the 25th.

25
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,140
So many of the Eastern Christian churches will celebrate their Christmas

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,060
this coming Wednesday,

27
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,700
and they did not celebrate on December the 25th when we celebrated Christmas.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,420
We may say the festival of Epiphany,

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,620
the coming of the wise men from the East,

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,160
they who were Gentiles coming and finding the Christ child.

31
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,840
We may say this morning what happened after Jesus was born in the manger.

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,380
Well, we know that on the 8th day in Bethlehem,

33
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,880
he was circumcised, as were all Jewish boys and given the name Jesus.

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,400
32 days later, Mary and Joseph took him,

35
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,140
which means he was 40 days old at the time.

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
They took him from Bethlehem,

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,000
and they went to Jerusalem to the temple.

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,740
And there they found, as we heard last Sunday,

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,260
they found Simeon the seer who blessed the Christ child,

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,760
and Anna the prophetess was there also.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,840
Then Mary and Joseph with the child came back to Bethlehem,

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,820
there to live, and it was some time after that

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,080
when the wise men came from the East.

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,940
And as these wise men came from the East,

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,840
they came to Jerusalem, and they asked the question,

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,820
where is he that is born King of the Jews?

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,800
Seemingly, Jerusalem knew nothing about his birth.

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,480
But this morning, as we celebrate the Epiphany Festival,

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,240
we are interested in what the wise men had to say

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,140
about this Christ child.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,160
And we asked them this morning,

52
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,880
wise men, what do you say about this child Jesus?

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,020
And their answer is this,

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,940
what child is this?

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,240
He is no less, they would tell you and me,

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,560
than the King of the Jews and more.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,800
He is the King of the Jews,

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
but he is more than the King of the Jews.

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,040
He is also the King of the Gentiles as well.

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,320
He is not only the Savior of the Jew,

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,680
he is also the Savior of the non-Jewish world,

62
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,520
both Jew and Gentile.

63
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,280
He is the King of all men.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,980
That's the answer of the wise men

65
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,780
today on this Festival of Epiphany.

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,020
And you and I, as we celebrate it,

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,280
we may look at this child again

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,940
and listen to the statement of the wise men,

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,640
this is the King of the Jews and more,

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
because they came,

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,600
they who were not Jews,

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
they who were Gentiles,

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,600
and they came and worshipped him as their King.

74
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,660
We may say,

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,520
but is there any conclusive evidence

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,440
that Jesus was the King of the Jews and more,

77
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,940
that he was also the King of non-Jews,

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,520
Gentiles as you and I are?

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,100
Is there any evidence?

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,620
In the first place,

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,420
I would offer this this morning.

82
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,360
There is the evidence of the wise men themselves.

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,440
How intriguing when we hear the story of the wise men.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,260
Oh, they came later, as we know,

85
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,460
because Herod ordered the slaughter of the infants

86
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,860
from two years and under.

87
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,180
It may have been a year or more later

88
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,560
after the birth of Jesus,

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,480
when the wise men came.

90
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,420
But we wonder, who were they?

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,340
How many were there?

92
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
You know, we talk about the three wise men,

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,500
do we not?

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,240
But the word of God doesn't tell us that there were three.

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,440
Tradition says there were three.

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,140
Now, when I use the word tradition,

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
understand that means it's not in scriptures,

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,620
but again,

99
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
it has grown up as part of the story.

100
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,580
Perhaps the most obvious reason

101
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,460
why we talk about three wise men

102
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,180
is because they presented three kinds of gifts,

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
gold and frankincense and myrrh.

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,220
And so again,

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,860
the world has said there were three.

106
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,560
We do not know how many there were.

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,040
It was quite a large entourage

108
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,020
because they traveled a long way.

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,180
And we ask ourselves,

110
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,580
where did they come from?

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,140
What do you mean from the east?

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Well, Bible scholars feel

113
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,420
that that is not too difficult a thing to answer,

114
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,080
to know where they came from.

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
If you remember some of your Jewish history,

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,820
you recall that in the year 586 before Christ,

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Nebuchadnezzar came out of Babylon

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,060
and came and destroyed the southern kingdom

119
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,920
and he carried the Jews away

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,740
into captivity down in Babylon.

121
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,260
And then after 70 years,

122
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,700
they were allowed to come back to their native land,

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
being in exile that length of time.

124
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,660
But many of the Jews remained in Babylon.

125
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,340
And therefore, it's most obvious to feel

126
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,300
that having Jews living in Babylon

127
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,000
for over 600 years,

128
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Jews who knew of their hope,

129
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,320
who knew of their Messiah,

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,740
who spoke of it,

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,360
it was very obvious

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,280
that the people in Babylon

133
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,380
and many of them

134
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,860
would know about the Jewish hope

135
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,440
and would be looking for that Messiah.

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,460
And then just as God,

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,180
when Jesus was manifested

138
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,200
to the shepherds who were Jews,

139
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,620
did a miracle,

140
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,500
and God again had an angel appear

141
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,940
and announce Jesus' birth

142
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,440
to the shepherds who were Jews,

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,420
and again the angelic choir,

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
so God again,

145
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,160
in announcing that this Christ child

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,480
is going to be the king of the Jews

147
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,340
and more,

148
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,020
king of the Gentiles,

149
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,600
God works a tremendous miracle.

150
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,000
We are told something about a star

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,680
that arose in the eastern sky.

152
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh yes, astronomers tell us

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,080
that back about that time,

154
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,580
there seemingly was a conjunction

155
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,840
of Jupiter and Saturn,

156
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,940
and we say,

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
does that answer the question?

158
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,940
It was from Chaldea over to Jerusalem

159
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,180
over 600 miles.

160
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,780
God placed a star,

161
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,720
these wise men were astronomers

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,900
or astrologers,

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,260
using something that they were interested in.

164
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,860
There was a star

165
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,120
that guided these wise men

166
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
and their entourage

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,640
over 600 miles

168
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,620
through the desert

169
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,780
by day and by night.

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,540
Say what we will about the star,

171
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,680
the only obvious answer is this,

172
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,980
that God placed a star.

173
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,860
Whether others saw it or not,

174
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,200
that you and I do not know,

175
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,360
but there was a star.

176
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,860
And the wise men,

177
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,000
as they saw it moving,

178
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,140
they followed it,

179
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,680
believing that this was going to be

180
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,000
the answer to that hope

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
that the Jew had in his land,

182
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,760
and that here they would find

183
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,220
the Savior for themselves too.

184
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,460
And so the star,

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,680
a miraculous miracle of God,

186
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
brought them to Jerusalem.

187
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,240
And when they came,

188
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,860
they asked,

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,520
where is he that is born

190
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,380
king of the Jews?

191
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,580
And when Herod, of course,

192
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,660
heard about another king,

193
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
and Herod thought that his throne,

194
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,940
therefore, was in danger,

195
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,780
Herod wanted to know all about it.

196
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,900
He called the chief priests

197
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,540
and scribes and says,

198
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,680
where is this king to be born?

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
And they told him rightly

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,880
that the prophet had said,

201
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,700
in Bethlehem.

202
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,580
And they quoted Micah's prophecy.

203
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,740
And then again,

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,820
these wise men

205
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,300
were certainly men of influence

206
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,600
because they had an interview

207
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,240
with the king.

208
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
He called them together privately

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,460
and he said,

210
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,260
just when did the star appear?

211
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,680
Herod wanted to know,

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,580
how long has it been

213
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,900
since you have seen this star?

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
He wanted to get an idea,

215
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,020
how old is this child?

216
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,320
And again,

217
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,840
they gave him all the information

218
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,380
they had,

219
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,020
and he told them

220
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,060
to go to Bethlehem.

221
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,780
There is where the king of the Jews

222
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,500
was to be born,

223
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,260
and then to come back

224
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,620
and to tell him about it.

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,720
And so they,

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,280
again,

227
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,920
they started from Jerusalem,

228
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,300
but bear this in mind,

229
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,620
when you start from Jerusalem,

230
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,500
you go south.

231
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,560
You're no longer going west,

232
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,480
and as they started south,

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,100
lo,

234
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,900
the star appeared again,

235
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,600
and we are told

236
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,660
that they were thrilled.

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,660
The star appeared,

238
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,720
it was guiding them

239
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,200
to the place

240
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
where they wanted to go.

241
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,920
They traveled six miles south,

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,520
and they came to Bethlehem.

243
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,300
And the star came,

244
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,540
and it stood over the place

245
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
where Jesus was,

246
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,100
and we are told

247
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,180
they went into the house.

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
Jesus was no longer

249
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,380
in the manger.

250
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,280
He was in the house

251
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,900
at the time,

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,340
and Mary was there,

253
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,180
and they went in.

254
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,400
These heathen people,

255
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,900
600 miles from the east

256
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,560
in Babylon,

257
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,060
they had come to Jerusalem,

258
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,280
and here was the king

259
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,620
of the Jews and more.

260
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,460
He was the king

261
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,580
of the Gentiles,

262
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,740
and they bowed down,

263
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,500
and they opened up

264
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,100
their gifts,

265
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,420
and they presented

266
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,620
unto him gifts,

267
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,060
gold and frankincense

268
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,000
and myrrh.

269
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,200
On this epiphany festival,

270
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,140
we ask the wise men,

271
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,820
who is this child?

272
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,760
What child is this?

273
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,460
And their answer,

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,820
he is the king

275
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,140
of the Jews and more.

276
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,080
He is the king

277
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,660
of the Jews

278
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,800
and also the king

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,740
of the Gentiles.

280
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,120
He is the savior

281
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,500
both of Jew and Gentile,

282
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
the savior of the entire

283
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,120
human race.

284
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,120
And here we are today

285
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,920
on the threshold

286
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,900
of a new year.

287
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,120
Would to God

288
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,940
that you and I

289
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,280
would take this king

290
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,100
of the Jews

291
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,420
and more with us

292
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
into this year.

293
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,020
I'd like to ask you

294
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,380
straight from the shoulder

295
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,120
this morning,

296
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,800
does it really do any good

297
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,860
in your life and mine

298
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,840
to take him along

299
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,140
with us into a new year?

300
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,640
Do you really see

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,280
any difference?

302
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,020
Or is that just stuff

303
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,260
you heard about in church?

304
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,820
Is that just stuff

305
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,780
for nice people?

306
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,880
Or does he make

307
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,360
any difference

308
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,060
in your life?

309
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,620
If you and I

310
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,320
take the king

311
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,920
of the Jews

312
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,760
and more along

313
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,080
with us in this year,

314
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
does he make

315
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,480
any difference?

316
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,160
Really now,

317
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,480
does he?

318
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,160
Do you see any difference

319
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,600
in your life?

320
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Does he make

321
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,100
this difference

322
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,880
that when you and I

323
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,660
take him along

324
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,960
as far as I am concerned

325
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
to take him along,

326
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,500
that means that

327
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,740
in this year

328
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,240
I am saved

329
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,620
and I am not lost?

330
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,920
Does that mean

331
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,800
anything to you and me?

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,100
Has the glitter

333
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,000
of salvation

334
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,500
worn itself thin?

335
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,080
Have you and I

336
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,380
lost the thrill

337
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,840
of being saved?

338
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,280
Not knowing

339
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,880
whether we're ever

340
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,280
going to see

341
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,040
the end of this year

342
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,540
or not.

343
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,540
Not knowing

344
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,500
how soon death

345
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,000
will come.

346
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,620
Does it mean anything

347
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,480
to have Jesus Christ

348
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,160
who is the king

349
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,880
of the Jews

350
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
and more

351
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,460
to be saved,

352
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,320
to be rescued

353
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,180
from sin,

354
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,880
from eternal death

355
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,660
and to have heaven?

356
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,460
Does it mean anything?

357
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,460
When Jesus said

358
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,640
it would be better

359
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,360
that that man

360
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,320
speaking about Judas

361
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,480
had never been born,

362
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,440
have you and I

363
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
really come to grips

364
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,880
with this

365
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,560
and have said to yourself

366
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,200
it would be better

367
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,180
I'd never been born

368
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,500
than to be without

369
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,520
Jesus Christ

370
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,320
and salvation?

371
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Could we look at it

372
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,380
this morning

373
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,900
in the light

374
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,760
of the wise men?

375
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,380
Salvation must be

376
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,520
something tremendous.

377
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,200
It must be

378
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,220
something hilarious.

379
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,040
If God almighty

380
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,120
by a miracle

381
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,080
picked up some

382
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
heathen men

383
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
in Babylon

384
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,540
led them over

385
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,220
600 miles of desert

386
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,400
led by a star

387
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,640
brought them to Bethlehem

388
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,040
and said

389
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,800
here is your savior too.

390
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,460
Here is the savior

391
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,000
not only of the Jew

392
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,220
but the savior

393
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,380
of the Gentile world.

394
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,220
If you and I

395
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,480
can take him along

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,360
he does make a difference.

397
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,860
It's the difference

398
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,220
between heaven and hell.

399
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,980
It's the difference

400
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,300
between being saved

401
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,180
and being lost.

402
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,680
The festival of epiphany.

403
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:23,880
Yes,

404
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,960
the coming of the wise men.

405
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,000
And the wise men

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,780
tell you and me

407
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,340
when we say

408
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,140
what child is this

409
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,980
wise men?

410
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,100
And they say

411
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,260
this is the king

412
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,860
of the Jews

413
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,520
and more.

414
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,480
Oh yes,

415
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,300
he's the king,

416
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:36,840
the savior,

417
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,020
the Jews all right

418
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,840
but he's more than that.

419
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,000
He is the savior

420
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,240
of the Gentiles.

421
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,920
He's the savior

422
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
of Jew and Gentile,

423
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,320
the savior of the world.

424
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,280
And you and I

425
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
may say today

426
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,960
at the beginning

427
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,660
of the new year

428
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,260
is there any evidence?

429
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh,

430
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,360
there's the evidence

431
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,180
as I have mentioned

432
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,200
of the wise men

433
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,660
themselves

434
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,100
but how about

435
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,660
the evidence

436
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,480
of prophecy?

437
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,180
Did prophecy say

438
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,760
that this babe

439
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
was to be

440
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,820
not only the king

441
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,420
of the Jews

442
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,220
but more

443
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,400
the king

444
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,260
of the Gentile world

445
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,700
too?

446
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,220
The savior of all?

447
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,500
When you look

448
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,160
into prophecy

449
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,880
again,

450
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,660
it's a tremendous

451
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,320
thing.

452
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,020
We go back

453
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,000
to the Garden of Eden.

454
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,240
You know,

455
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,300
it's rather interesting.

456
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,660
We don't know

457
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,460
exactly where

458
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,240
the Garden of Eden

459
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
was but

460
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,540
the cradle of humanity

461
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,140
was over in Mesopotamia,

462
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,740
in other words,

463
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,500
in Babylon

464
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,300
where the wise men

465
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,020
had come from.

466
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,240
Somewhere around

467
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,140
in that area

468
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,840
in the world

469
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,960
a God created man

470
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,820
and there was

471
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,840
the Garden of Eden.

472
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,200
And you know,

473
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,960
when we go back

474
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,040
to the Garden of Eden

475
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,600
Adam and Eve

476
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
when they had sinned

477
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,620
and there was Satan

478
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,080
you remember

479
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,180
what God said to them

480
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
and I will put enmity

481
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,880
between thee

482
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,320
and the woman

483
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,300
between thy seed

484
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,000
and her seed

485
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,580
it shall bruise thy head

486
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,820
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

487
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,960
God promised

488
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,940
the seed of the woman

489
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
that again

490
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,840
would be the savior

491
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,160
of Adam and Eve

492
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,460
who in embryo

493
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,500
they again

494
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,380
had the world

495
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,720
within themselves.

496
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,100
There were

497
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,660
no diverse races.

498
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,900
The very first promise

499
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,720
of a savior

500
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,620
the seed of the woman

501
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,040
then

502
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,220
was one

503
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,820
to be a universal savior

504
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,680
not just

505
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,160
for one little group.

506
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
Go to the time

507
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,160
of Noah

508
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,780
when Noah

509
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,240
blessed his oldest son

510
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,740
Shem.

511
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,900
He did say

512
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,780
blessed be the Lord

513
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,540
God of Shem

514
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,760
and Shem was again

515
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,840
the progenitor

516
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,900
of the Jewish race

517
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,660
who are the Semitic people.

518
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,960
In other words

519
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,060
this Messiah

520
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,820
this king

521
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,960
would come from Shem

522
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
but he also said

523
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,960
to Japheth

524
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
who was the second

525
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,540
oldest son

526
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,060
Japheth shall dwell

527
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,220
in the tents of Shem.

528
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,700
Japheth

529
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,180
you shall enjoy

530
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,140
the blessings

531
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,080
that will come

532
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,620
from Shem.

533
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,480
Already

534
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,060
Japheth was again

535
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,800
the forefather

536
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
of all Gentile races.

537
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Gentiles

538
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,200
were to share.

539
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,800
You take Abraham

540
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
God told Abraham

541
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,980
who was the father

542
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,780
of the Jewish race

543
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,120
he said

544
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,660
Abraham

545
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,540
in thee and in thy seed

546
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,900
shall all the nations

547
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,540
of the earth

548
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,140
be blessed.

549
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,440
Prophecy

550
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,100
never excluded

551
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,260
the Gentile.

552
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,540
Prophecy

553
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,060
in telling

554
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,720
that Jesus

555
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,340
would come

556
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,380
from the Jewish line

557
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,920
nevertheless

558
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,400
always included him

559
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,300
as the savior

560
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,960
of the Jew

561
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,680
but more

562
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,820
the savior

563
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,740
of the Gentiles.

564
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Take that matchless

565
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,860
piece of prophecy

566
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,820
that was our epistle

567
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,860
lesson from Isaiah

568
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,980
the 60th chapter.

569
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,200
Isaiah lived

570
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,240
700 years

571
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,320
before the Christian era

572
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,700
and when he saw it

573
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,060
he says

574
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,180
arise shine

575
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,260
for thy light

576
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,860
has come

577
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,780
and the glory

578
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,320
of the Lord

579
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,300
is risen upon thee

580
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,760
and then he said

581
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,280
for Gentiles

582
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,920
shall come

583
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,860
to thy light

584
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,080
and kings

585
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,060
to the brightness

586
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,240
of thy rising.

587
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,420
Did you ever wonder

588
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,980
why we

589
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,040
again we have

590
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,600
we call them

591
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,360
three wise men

592
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,380
we call them kings

593
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,220
Matthew doesn't say

594
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,040
they were kings

595
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,560
Isaiah says

596
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,540
and Gentiles

597
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,060
shall come

598
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,720
to thy light

599
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,280
and kings

600
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,920
to the brightness

601
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
of thy rising.

602
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,000
Our forefathers

603
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,500
believed

604
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,440
that the wise men

605
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
companies

606
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,940
were a direct

607
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,380
fulfillment

608
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,480
of Isaiah 60.

609
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,720
That's why

610
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,980
they called them kings

611
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,360
they were the Gentiles

612
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
because they presented

613
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,740
unto him gifts

614
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,680
they presented

615
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,060
unto him gold

616
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,600
and frankincense.

617
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,540
So again

618
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,760
we call them kings

619
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,000
because Isaiah said

620
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,640
kings shall come

621
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,720
to thy rising

622
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,260
and so again

623
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,900
prophecy

624
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,620
certainly never

625
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,220
excluded the Gentile world

626
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,900
that's you

627
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,880
and that is I

628
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,660
we are Gentiles

629
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,820
non-Jews

630
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,860
we were never excluded

631
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,060
this babe

632
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,020
was to be the king

633
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,540
of the Jews

634
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,080
to be sure

635
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,720
but more

636
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,960
but then we look

637
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,440
at Jesus

638
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,060
and we say

639
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,420
well how about

640
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,060
Jesus himself

641
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,100
was he a

642
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,460
pure blooded

643
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:35,860
Jew

644
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,140
according to the flesh

645
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,060
or was there any

646
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,620
Gentile blood

647
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,560
in the veins

648
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,280
of Jesus

649
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
when I was in the

650
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Holy Land

651
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,600
in the Middle East

652
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,760
we came to the

653
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,940
ruins of Jericho

654
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,200
and I shall never

655
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,360
forget that experience

656
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,140
seeing again

657
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,760
the ruins

658
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,460
where once stood

659
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,340
the city of Jericho

660
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,460
and several members

661
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,000
of the party

662
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,680
who didn't know

663
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,440
the story that had

664
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,700
occurred

665
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,080
they came up

666
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,320
and said

667
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,260
what happened

668
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,840
at Jericho

669
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,640
would you tell us

670
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,200
about it

671
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,860
what really took

672
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,100
place

673
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,920
well you know

674
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,480
we remember

675
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,460
this about Jericho

676
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,040
do we not

677
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,220
when Moses died

678
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,840
and Joshua

679
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,480
took command

680
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,100
and they crossed

681
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,600
the Jordan

682
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,540
and they came

683
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,240
and they surrounded

684
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,100
the city of Jericho

685
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,400
you know

686
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,220
on the seventh day

687
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,800
they went around

688
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,600
it seven times

689
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,100
and the walls

690
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,580
of Jericho

691
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,940
fell

692
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,040
and that's about

693
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,760
all that some

694
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,420
of us remember

695
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,300
about Jericho

696
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,400
but oh there's

697
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,220
an intensely

698
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,240
interesting thing

699
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,800
that the Bible

700
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,440
tells us

701
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,600
remember Joshua

702
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,660
sent spies

703
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,520
into the city

704
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,460
before they took it

705
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,540
and they went

706
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,440
to the home

707
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
of the prostitute

708
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,600
of the city

709
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,380
of Jericho

710
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,120
and her name

711
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
was Rahab

712
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,720
remember Rahab

713
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,760
and Rahab

714
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,980
hid the spies

715
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,640
so that they

716
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
weren't killed

717
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,180
and then she

718
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,980
was promised

719
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,940
by the spies

720
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,020
that when they

721
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,560
would take

722
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,620
the city of Jericho

723
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,560
that if she

724
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,460
would put a

725
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,760
scarlet cord

726
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,140
in her window

727
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
and have her

728
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,160
family in that

729
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,700
house

730
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,280
that the Israelites

731
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,740
would not hurt

732
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,300
her

733
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,180
or her family

734
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,580
the town

735
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,900
prostitute

736
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,540
put a

737
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,440
scarlet cord

738
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,720
in the window

739
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,660
rather strange

740
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,280
isn't it

741
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,620
3500

742
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,760
years ago

743
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,720
a prostitute

744
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,440
put a

745
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,940
red cord

746
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,000
in her window

747
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,820
and to this

748
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,360
day

749
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,380
the places

750
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,420
of ill fame

751
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,100
in cities

752
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,440
and metropolitan

753
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,980
areas

754
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,260
are still called

755
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,700
red light

756
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,660
districts

757
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,500
after the

758
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,460
red cord

759
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,680
and prostitutes

760
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,740
are called

761
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,020
scarlet

762
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,760
women

763
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,440
because

764
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Rahab

765
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,220
3500

766
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,520
years ago

767
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,240
put a

768
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,480
red cord

769
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,120
in her

770
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,740
window

771
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,320
but it's

772
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,720
also

773
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,660
significant

774
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,280
that

775
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,340
the blood

776
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,040
of Jesus

777
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,300
is red

778
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,480
and

779
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,280
that

780
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,880
shed

781
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,320
blood

782
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,000
of Jesus

783
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,560
that

784
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,280
cord

785
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,920

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,620
Jews

996
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,260
but oh

997
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,160
more than

998
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,800
that

999
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,100
the king

1000
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,760
of the

1001
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,900
Gentiles

1002
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,460
of the

1003
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,600
non-Jews

1004
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,760
the savior

1005
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,380
of all

1006
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,700
men

1007
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,540
could God

1008
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,960
in his

1009
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,320
mercy

1010
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,360
have done

1011
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,720
it any

1012
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:26,900
more

1013
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,400
beautifully

1014
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,120
than just

1015
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,580
that

1016
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
and that's

1017
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,400
why this

1018
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
morning on

1019
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
the first

1020
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,060
Sunday of

1021
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,580
a new

1022
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,940
year

1023
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,500
I ask you

1024
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,160
let's take

1025
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,860
him along

1026
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,240
does he

1027
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,700
make any

1028
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,440
difference

1029
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,240
let's get

1030
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,820
down to

1031
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,540
brass tacks

1032
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:42,940
does he

1033
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,320
make any

1034
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,760
difference in

1035
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,160
your life

1036
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,660
or mine

1037
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,460
or do we

1038
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:45,960
just kid

1039
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,520
ourselves

1040
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,700
I insist

1041
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,200
that he

1042
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,740
makes a

1043
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,340
difference

1044
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,940
when you

1045
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,320
take him

1046
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,840
along

1047
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,060
the difference

1048
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,780
between being

1049
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,400
saved and

1050
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,960
being lost

1051
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,340
but there's

1052
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,000
another thing

1053
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,360
it's the

1054
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,000
difference between

1055
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,680
having peace

1056
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,260
of mind and

1057
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,060
not having it

1058
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,160
I don't care

1059
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,040
who you are

1060
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,460
or how

1061
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,320
intelligent or

1062
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,100
educated you

1063
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,500
may be

1064
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,140
I know this

1065
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,700
just as sure

1066
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,200
as I'm sure

1067
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,660
that God

1068
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,140
lives

1069
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,380
there isn't

1070
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,860
any peace

1071
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,280
of mind

1072
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,920
outside of

1073
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
Jesus Christ

1074
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,420
if you've

1075
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,880
got peace

1076
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,320
of mind

1077
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,880
apart from

1078
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,300
him you're

1079
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,960
just deluding

1080
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,500
yourself

1081
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,100
you don't

1082
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,700
have it

1083
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,620
it's the

1084
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,140
ostrich

1085
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,720
complex

1086
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,300
you're just

1087
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,860
burying your

1088
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,160
head

1089
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,800
I know this

1090
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,420
just as sure

1091
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,220
as I'm alive

1092
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,660
that the only

1093
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,460
peace of mind

1094
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,120
that can come

1095
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,720
to you is the

1096
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,160
only kind

1097
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,620
that can come

1098
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,900
to me

1099
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,480
because I've

1100
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,900
got a guilty

1101
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,380
conscience

1102
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,940
and so have

1103
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,180
you

1104
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,200
I know that

1105
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm a sinner

1106
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,220
and so do

1107
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,500
you

1108
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,760
the only way

1109
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,160
in the world

1110
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,580
to get rid

1111
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:35,960
of a guilty

1112
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,400
conscience

1113
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,960
is not to

1114
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,520
cover it up

1115
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,020
and not look

1116
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,420
at it

1117
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,900
but again

1118
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,360
to take

1119
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,240
Jesus Christ

1120
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,820
and let his

1121
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,160
blood wash

1122
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,560
it whiter

1123
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,140
than snow

1124
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,260
and when

1125
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,800
again

1126
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,760
he washes

1127
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,460
your soul

1128
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,880
and mine

1129
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,420
whiter than

1130
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:48,640
snow

1131
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,320
that conscience

1132
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,900
no longer

1133
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,860
condemns

1134
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,520
then you

1135
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,940
and I've

1136
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,420
got peace

1137
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,020
of mind

1138
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,280
all troubles

1139
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,920
are going

1140
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,660
to come

1141
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,180
who in the

1142
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,700
world is

1143
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,120
going to

1144
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,900
escape trouble

1145
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,300
in this

1146
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,660
year

1147
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,920
all of us

1148
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,440
shall have

1149
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,900
troubles

1150
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,540
the big thing

1151
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,940
is how

1152
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,360
shall we

1153
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,980
bear them

1154
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,720
but I

1155
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,260
know this

1156
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,540
that if

1157
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,180
I've got

1158
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,560
him

1159
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,620
and I've

1160
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,360
got forgiveness

1161
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,040
every day

1162
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,480
in him

1163
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,120
and I belong

1164
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,640
to him

1165
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,700
that in

1166
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,220
spite of

1167
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,700
what comes

1168
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,040
I know

1169
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,400
he's not

1170
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,800
punishing

1171
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,200
me

1172
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,260
I know

1173
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,540
that he

1174
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:16,880
is not

1175
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,280
angry

1176
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,980
with me

1177
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,400
I know

1178
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,780
that he

1179
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,480
loves me

1180
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,820
and I

1181
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,260
know my

1182
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,820
sins are

1183
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,240
forgiven

1184
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,940
it does

1185
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,460
make a

1186
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,920
difference

1187
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,380
friend

1188
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,100
whether you

1189
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,480
take him

1190
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,960
along or

1191
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,360
not it

1192
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,820
makes a

1193
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,680
tremendous

1194
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,660
difference

1195
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,260
oh epiphany

1196
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,440
that tremendous

1197
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,520
ancient festival

1198
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,180
of the church

1199
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,200
when again

1200
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,080
Gentiles said

1201
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,940
this is our

1202
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,620
Lord too

1203
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,180
he's the

1204
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,780
king of the

1205
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,520
Jews but he's

1206
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,200
more than that

1207
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,880
he's the

1208
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,320
king of the

1209
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,960
Gentiles

1210
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,080
and we

1211
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,560
say is there

1212
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,100
any evidence

1213
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,680
so not only

1214
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,100
the evidence

1215
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,700
of the wise

1216
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,260
men and not

1217
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,880
only the evidence

1218
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,460
of prophecy

1219
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,240
but the evidence

1220
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,780
of Jesus

1221
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,240
himself and

1222
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,980
his church

1223
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,840
when you

1224
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,440
stand at the

1225
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,960
cross of

1226
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,540
Christ did

1227
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,120
Jesus ever

1228
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,200
say that

1229
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,160
again his

1230
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,000
salvation that

1231
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,640
he was rendering

1232
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,300
on the cross

1233
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,160
was only for a

1234
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,780
certain few

1235
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,940
didn't Jesus

1236
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,800
say for God

1237
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,420
so loved the

1238
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,900
world

1239
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,800
didn't he

1240
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,700
come to be

1241
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,200
the world

1242
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,600
savior

1243
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,420
didn't Christ

1244
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,060
as the son

1245
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,680
of God

1246
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,780
come into the

1247
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,280
world and

1248
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,880
therefore show

1249
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,180
himself

1250
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,800
to be big

1251
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,480
enough to

1252
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,200
die for your

1253
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,860
sins and

1254
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,500
mine and

1255
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,320
also for the

1256
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,200
sins of the

1257
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Jews as

1258
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,340
well as

1259
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,420
non-Jews

1260
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,860
the tragedy

1261
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,580
of it all

1262
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,320
is that Jesus

1263
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
says he came

1264
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,020
to his own

1265
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,620
and his own

1266
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,400
received him

1267
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,860
not

1268
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,000
oh yes they

1269
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,860
don't receive

1270
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,480
him but oh

1271
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,020
that manger

1272
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,920
child he was

1273
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,400
the king of

1274
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,140
the Jews

1275
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,280
but oh thank

1276
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,860
God he was

1277
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,400
more he was

1278
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,900
your king and

1279
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,500
mine too

1280
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,620
he was the

1281
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,040
king for

1282
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,720
everybody when

1283
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,100
he picked

1284
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,680
Saul of

1285
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,320
Tarsus on

1286
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,000
the Damascus

1287
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,060
way he

1288
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,680
told Saul

1289
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,180
that he was

1290
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,900
to be again

1291
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,420
his witness

1292
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,820
to the

1293
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,580
Gentiles and

1294
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,140
Paul went

1295
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,040
out and he

1296
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,540
preached to

1297
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,080
the Jew and

1298
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,740
he preached to

1299
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,780
the Gentile

1300
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,240

1301
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Christian church

1302
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,400

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,080

Bethlehem this

1316
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,240
one that the

1317
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,080
wise men came

1318
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,340
to worship why

1319
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,300
he is the

1320
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,860
king of the

1321
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,580
Jews but he's

1322
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,500
more he's the

1323
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:15,980
king of the

1324
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,040
world yours and

of all men

1327
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,660
without exception

1328
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,400
my prayer is

1329
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,580
today that as

1330
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,340
we stand on the

1331
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,900
threshold of

1332
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,020
65 that we'll

1333
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,820
take him along

1334
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,060
he does make a

1335
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,740
difference really

1336
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
he does God

1337
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,340
pity the man

1338
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,920
that doesn't

1339
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,620
have him

1340
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,200
because if we

1341
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,980
take him along

1342
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,940
I'm sure this we

1343
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,440
don't have to be

1344
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,240
afraid of tomorrow

1345
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,420
I had two rather

1346
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,840
interesting experiences

1347
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
on the afternoon

1348
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,860
of New Year's

1349
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,520
Eve I met two

1350
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
different people

1351
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,360
who expressed

1352
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,440
themselves about

1353
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,860
New Year's

1354
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,960
Eve one said I

1364
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,720
don't know why

1365
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,320
but I'm very

1366
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,500
despondent when

when I have taken

1405
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
him with me there

1406
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,280

1407
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
to take me away

1408
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,220
from him against

1409
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,800
my will look what

1410
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,860
happened the wise

1411
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,940
men gave him the

1412
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,440
gifts and then in

1413
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,620
a dream that night

1414
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,660
God appeared to

1415
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,480
them and told them

1416
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,420
not to go back to

1417
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,180
Herod but to go

1418
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
another way and the

1419
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,840
next day when Herod

1420
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,920
found out that again

1421
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,140
they had fooled him

1422
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,480
Herod was simply

1423
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,780
filled with vehemence

1424
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,900
and with hatred and

1425
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,560
he ordered the

1426
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,220
soldiers into

1427
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,120
Bethlehem and they

1428
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,000
killed all the

1429
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,100
little boys some two

1430
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,520
years and down you

1431
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,200
see he played it

1432
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,160
wide he thought this

1433
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,060
child can't be more

1434
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,840
than two years old

1435
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,060
we'll kill them all

1436
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,900
and then we hear a

1437
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,860
prophecy that Rachel

1438
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,620
was weeping for

1439
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,760
her children I

1440
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,400
thought of that when

1441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,640
I was in Rachel's

1442
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,520
tomb right outside

1443
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,020
of Bethlehem she's

1444
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,760
standing for the

1445
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,560
mother again of

1446
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,400
believers and Rachel

1447
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,120
weeping for her

1448
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,920
children because they

1449
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
were dead Rachel of

1450
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,020
old who died when

1451
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,800
she gave birth to

1452
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,280
Benjamin but what

1453
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,220
happened that same

1454
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,320
night the angel came

1455
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
to Joseph in a dream

1456
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,140
and said get up this

1457
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
very night and go to

1458
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,600
Egypt and again flee

1459
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,480
for the child's life

1460
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,500
did God take care of

1461
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,520
this little babe and

1462
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,440
Joseph and Mary got

1463
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,140
up to that little babe

1464
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,800
and they started for

1465
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
Egypt now from

1466
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,340

1467
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,800
Bethlehem down into

1468
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,020
Egypt to go down to

1469
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,120
Memphis or Heliopolis

1470
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,220
it's about 250 miles

1471
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,080
you may wonder where

1472
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,880
did Joseph get any

1473
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,760
money for a trip like

1474
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,060
that oh God saw to it

1475
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,120
those wise men they

1476
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
presented him gifts

1477
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,260
gold that's where in

1478
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,360
the providence of God

1479
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,660
God provided the money

1480
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,460
that he could go down

1481
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,420
to Egypt I was in

1482
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,280
Heliopolis I was down

1483
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,240
in Cairo I was in a

1484
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,140
little shrine where they

1485
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,500
tell us that here it

1486
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,520
was that Joseph and

1487
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,380
Mary came down they

1488
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,320
lived in Egypt may have

1489
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,060
been there for about a

1490
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,380
year until Herod died

1491
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,000
but God took care of

1492
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
that child and again

1493
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,740
after that time an angel

1494
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
came and said Herod is

1495
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,760
now dead now you can

1496
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,320
return so Joseph and

1497
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,240
Mary was the child they

1498
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
came back intending to

1499
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,220
stay in Bethlehem but

1500
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,440
they found that Archelaus

1501
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,740
Herod's son was on the

1502
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,640
throne they were afraid

1503
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,440
so they didn't remain in

1504
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,320
Bethlehem they went on

1505
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
up to Nazareth up in

1506
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,780
Galilee their hometown

1507
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,020
about a hundred miles

1508
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,840
from Bethlehem and there

1509
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,640
