1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,420
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,340
Let us hear the Word of God as we find it written in Paul's second letter to Timothy.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,700
Read there in the second chapter, beginning at the eighth verse.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,600
Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,060
wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds, but the Word of God is not bound.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:45,000
Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,380
It is a faithful saying, for if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him.

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,220
If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,020
If we deny him, he will also deny us.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,880
If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himself.

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,880
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,020
O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,040
Amen.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:26,060
Good morning, dear friends, in Christ Jesus, you who are here in God's house,

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,200
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshiping with us by means of the radio.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,320
Today, the second Sunday in May, as you know, is Mother's Day.

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,280
Some of you have the honor of having your mother in church with you this morning.

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,020
Some of you will visit your mother sometime today.

19
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,060
Some of you will call your mother and speak with her before this day is brought to an end.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,500
Some of you have written to your mother and have expressed your love and your endearment to her.

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,380
Others of us today have only mothers of memory.

22
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,500
On this Mother's Day, I ask myself the question,

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,340
what shall I say to you today, Christian mother?

24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,280
What shall be my message to you

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,220
when I am assured that our nation's number one problem is this one,

26
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:45,600
our youth and, again, a growing lawlessness against decency and order?

27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,560
What shall I say to you this morning, Christian mother,

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,460
when I am told that our chief problem is our young people

29
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,460
and growing immorality and the social diseases which go with it?

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
What shall I say to you this morning?

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,960
What shall I say to you this morning when I am told

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,920
that our greatest need and our greatest perplexing problem

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,640
is our youth and the growing crime rate?

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,200
What shall I say to you, Christian mother?

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,220
Christian mother, you may be saying this to yourself today.

36
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,260
You may say, I know as a Christian mother,

37
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,780
I've got the word of God that I am to give to my child.

38
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,840
But you may be losing confidence in it.

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,960
You may be saying to yourself, if only it had more power,

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,780
if only it had more dynamite, if only it had more energy.

41
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,880
It doesn't seem to be adequate.

42
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,940
It doesn't seem to do the job that I am called upon to do with my child or with my children.

43
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,960
You may be losing confidence in the power and the efficacy of that word.

44
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,080
To you, Christian mother, I would like to give Paul's answer

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,440
as we find Paul writing in his second letter to Timothy.

46
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,340
If you recall, Paul was in jail in Rome when he wrote these words.

47
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,900
And he wrote to young Timothy and he said to Timothy,

48
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,500
Timothy, remember this, that I have preached the risen Christ.

49
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,220
That's the heart of my gospel.

50
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,100
And then he said, Timothy, because of that, I have endured many hardships.

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,820
He says, I have even been put in chains as a common prisoner.

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,040
And then he said, but the word of God is not in chains, Timothy.

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,080
The word of God is not bound.

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,520
It isn't held up.

55
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,340
And Christian mother, today I want to tell you this about the word of God that you have.

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,780
It is not in chains.

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,600
It is not bound.

58
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,840
It is not held down.

59
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,600
It is not tethered.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,680
That word of God, there's nothing wrong with it.

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,940
It is absolutely adequate.

62
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,760
It's got all the power and the energy and the dynamite

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,760
so that there is no reason in God's world for your child or children ever to grow up

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:19,000
and to grow up for a life of immorality and incest, a life of crime, and a life of disregard for law and for order.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,820
That word of God is not bound, Paul says, thank God.

66
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
It is not in chains.

67
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you have confidence, Christian mother, in the word of God that it's not bound?

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,180
May I assure you it is not in chains.

69
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,080
It is absolutely adequate.

70
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,280
There is nothing lacking because the Holy Spirit works in the word of God.

71
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,940
God, the third person of the Trinity, the word assures us, he works in the word of God and listen, because he does.

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,840
There is nothing more that he could do with the word of God than what he does.

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,620
Don't lose confidence in the power and the efficacy and the adequacy of the word of God.

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,120
I'd like to remind you, Christian mother, in the first place of this fact,

75
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:24,180
that the Holy Spirit, through the word and water, he still causes your child or children to be born again.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Has baptism somehow or other failed?

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
Or isn't that a tremendous thing that the Holy Spirit does through the word?

78
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,380
Bear in mind that baptism is still the word of God.

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,580
It's the word of God added to water.

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,020
And bear in mind when Nicodemus was talking to Jesus that night,

81
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,560
that Jesus told Nicodemus, if you want to get into the kingdom, you've got to be born again.

82
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,240
Just to be born physically is not enough.

83
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,160
And therefore, Christian mother, because your child was born physically, that's not enough.

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,320
Jesus says, that which is born of the flesh is flesh.

85
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,140
That's sinful.

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,060
And your child, as you know, came into this world subject to death and it was a sinner.

87
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,340
Not that it had done wrong, but it came into the world in a condition of sin.

88
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,040
And yet Jesus says, it must be born again.

89
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,700
Bear in mind that the Holy Spirit, by means of the word of God and lowly water,

90
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:27,140
causes your child or children to be born again, a spiritual birth, raised from death to life, spiritually speaking.

91
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,580
And that in that baptism that the Holy Spirit had still through the word of God in water,

92
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,460
he kindles faith in your child's heart.

93
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh, it's not a conscious faith, but in that faith in Christ, your child's sins are forgiven.

94
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,120
Your child is delivered from eternal death.

95
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Your child has eternal life.

96
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,980
I ask you this morning, Christian mother, could the Holy Spirit do any more than that as he does in baptism?

97
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:04,060
And then in baptism, because there is a faith in Christ, the Holy Spirit places Christ in the heart of your child or children.

98
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:15,360
And he watches over that child, that Satan and the fallen angels shall never grasp that soul away from that infant for themselves.

99
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,400
Do you believe in guardian angels?

100
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,780
Don't you realize, Christian mother, that the Holy Spirit through this tremendous word,

101
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,940
when by baptism Christ comes into the heart of your child,

102
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,860
that Christ stands there and he says to Satan,

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,180
No, no, you don't.

104
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,180
You leave this soul alone.

105
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,180
This soul belongs to me.

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,480
I ask you on Mother's Day,

107
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,440
do you think that the Holy Spirit could do more than that,

108
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,760
than what he does in baptism?

109
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,840
And then let's look at you this morning.

110
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,960
If there is something inadequate,

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
if we are losing confidence,

112
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,920
if there is something missing,

113
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,800
may I first of all tell you,

114
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,460
have this confidence that it's not in the word.

115
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,500
The word of God is not in chains, Paul said.

116
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not bound, it's not tethered, it's not held fast.

117
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,440
When you realize that the word of God,

118
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,380
it's got everything,

119
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,820
therefore that there's no reason why your child or children should ever grow up

120
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,040
for lives of immorality or incest or lawlessness or crime,

121
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,840
then will you see to it

122
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,560
that your child or children are baptized

123
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,260
and that you treat them as baptized children.

124
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,540
In the Old Testament,

125
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,340
the child, the male,

126
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,540
was circumcised on the eighth day.

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,260
It was early.

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
And therefore, again,

129
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,400
it ought to be early in the life of your child,

130
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,160
Christian Mother,

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,260
when you bring that child to holy baptism,

132
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,800
when that child is born a second time

133
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,440
of water and the word of God

134
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
by means of the Holy Spirit.

135
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,500
When Christ moves into that child's heart,

136
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,500
and Christ holds on,

137
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
and Satan doesn't take that soul

138
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,220
and doesn't grasp it away from Jesus.

139
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,860
And then will you see to it

140
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,480
that you treat that child

141
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,280
as a baptized child ought to be treated.

142
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,540
You know, Christian Mother,

143
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,420
it's strange the children that come to me sometimes

144
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,640
and they're starved for love.

145
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
Why is it the children come and say,

146
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,660
I've never seen my mother kiss my daddy.

147
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,900
I have never seen daddy kiss my mother.

148
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,820
I don't know what it is

149
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,620
to be kissed by my mother.

150
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,540
I don't know what it means

151
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,920
to be tucked in bed

152
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,620
with a goodnight kiss at night.

153
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,780
I had an adult sit in my office one day

154
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,280
and he cried like a child.

155
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,480
And he said to me,

156
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,760
I'm hearing things I've never heard in my life.

157
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,920
I don't know what a Christian home is.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,120
Believe me, I don't.

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,620
He sat there and he sobbed.

160
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,460
I don't know what it is

161
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,080
to have a mother that ever kissed me.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,540
You know, during the Korean conflict

163
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,860
on the cover of Life magazine,

164
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,740
do you remember it?

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
There was a picture of a Korean refugee,

166
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,340
a little boy

167
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,860
about the size of my oldest grandchild today.

168
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
And they said,

169
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,260
the little boy that never smiled.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
Can you imagine?

171
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,660
A little boy that could never smile.

172
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,020
Yes, he lost everything.

173
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,720
Father and mother,

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,840
sisters and brothers

175
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,740
and a little waif

176
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,720
about five or six years of old.

177
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
They gave him ice cream

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and they gave him all kinds of candy.

179
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,120
And he couldn't smile

180
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,540
because he didn't know what love meant.

181
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,600
And it took months until finally,

182
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,120
oh, that picture has haunted me,

183
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
to find with that little Korean waif,

184
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,940
he learned how to smile.

185
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,160
What kind of soil,

186
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,440
Christian mother,

187
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,460
do you have in your home

188
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,020
for your baptized children

189
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,440
who belong to Christ?

190
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,760
Is it a little bit of heaven on earth

191
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,460
or is it a living hell?

192
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,460
If it's a living hell,

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
let me tell you this morning,

194
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,540
there isn't anything else

195
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,780
that you can do

196
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,720
that is going to erase

197
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
that kind of a background

198
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,300
if your child doesn't have love

199
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
and is starved.

200
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,860
Why, even the sunflower,

201
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,080
when the sun shines

202
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,040
with its radiancy and warmth,

203
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,640
it turns to the sun.

204
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,200
Your child,

205
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
I'm asking you,

206
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,400
bringing it right down

207
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,380
in your home and mine.

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,580
Is there any love?

209
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,740
Is it a little bit of heaven on earth?

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,340
Could that be what is lacking?

211
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,140
If it is,

212
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,660
God pity you,

213
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,460
Christian mother.

214
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,620
You say to me,

215
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,760
what can I say

216
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,540
to a Christian mother today

217
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,320
when we are told

218
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,020
the nation's number one problem

219
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,980
is that of youth

220
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,040
and growing immorality

221
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,380
and growing incest

222
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,860
and growing lawlessness

223
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,100
and again,

224
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,580
growing immorality

225
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,520
and crime

226
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,680
and you as a Christian mother

227
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,160
can say,

228
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,020
and here we've got

229
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,860
the word of God

230
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,740
but there seems to be

231
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,540
something lacking.

232
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,040
It doesn't seem to have

233
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,780
what it ought to have.

234
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,760
It doesn't have the zip.

235
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,700
It doesn't have the punch.

236
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,440
It doesn't have the dynamic,

237
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,180
doesn't it?

238
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,640
Paul in jail

239
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,580
told young Timothy,

240
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,880
thank God the word

241
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,060
is not in chains.

242
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,180
It's not bound.

243
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,540
It's not tethered.

244
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh,

245
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,360
the word of God's got everything.

246
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,960
Don't lose confidence,

247
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,780
Christian mother,

248
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,060
in the word of God

249
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,180
because the Holy Spirit

250
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,640
works in the word of God.

251
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,320
That means in the second place

252
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
have confidence in it

253
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,380
because the Holy Spirit

254
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,140
still through this word

255
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,260
he feeds that faith

256
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,660
of your child

257
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,480
or your children.

258
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,560
Yes,

259
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,000
you see,

260
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,920
you are the one

261
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,140
to teach the child

262
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,160
the word of God.

263
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
Do you realize,

264
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,180
Christian mother,

265
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,440
that as you take time

266
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,600
to teach your child

267
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,780
about this Christ

268
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,020
in whose name

269
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,420
your child was baptized,

270
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,300
this Jesus living within him,

271
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
that that faith

272
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
and that confidence

273
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,200
begins to grow

274
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,900
as you tell him

275
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,400
the story about Bethlehem

276
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,940
and as you still tell him

277
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,980
the story about Jesus

278
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,040
that died on the cross

279
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,520
for him

280
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,760
and as you tell him

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,600
the beautiful story

282
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,540
about the resurrection

283
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,180
of Jesus,

284
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,160
you realize that as you,

285
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,200
the great teacher

286
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
and the first teacher

287
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,880
that comes to your child,

288
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,540
you realize what the Holy Spirit

289
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,140
does through that word of God

290
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,200
as you teach that child

291
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,320
why the Holy Spirit

292
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,400
working through the word,

293
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,900
he causes that faith

294
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,740
and that confidence

295
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,960
to grow larger and larger

296
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,780
and larger

297
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,080
and tell that child

298
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,200
he grows in love

299
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
for Christ

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,860
and in love for heaven.

301
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,780
I talked to a little

302
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,060
four-year-old boy one day,

303
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,880
I was making a call

304
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,240
at the home

305
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,340
and he was riding his bicycle

306
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,080
out in the street

307
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,460
and I said,

308
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,480
you better get on the sidewalk,

309
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,460
you may get run over

310
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,260
and you may be killed

311
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,500
and he looked up at me

312
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,480
and all the seriousness

313
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,660
of a four-year-old

314
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,140
and he rather smiled

315
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,700
and he says,

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
then I would be with Jesus

317
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,380
in heaven,

318
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,960
wouldn't I?

319
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,340
Oh, what a faith.

320
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,560
Oh, what a faith.

321
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,540
And Christian mother,

322
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,620
you think there's something

323
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,440
lacking in the word of God?

324
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,720
Do you think that

325
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,580
as you teach this word of God

326
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,540
that there is nothing

327
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,340
that you can do,

328
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
that this word is inadequate,

329
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,300
that somehow or other

330
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,660
your child or your children

331
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,700
must grow up

332
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,580
to live lives of immorality

333
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,560
and incest

334
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,600
and lawlessness

335
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,100
and in crime?

336
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,840
Oh, the word of God,

337
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,440
it's not in chains.

338
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,760
What more could

339
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,260
the Holy Spirit do

340
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,720
in the case of your child

341
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,520
or your children

342
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,580
than to have that faith

343
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,560
blossom forth

344
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,900
in a real confidence

345
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,800
that heaven is real?

346
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,940
And to whom is heaven

347
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,540
more real

348
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
than to a little child?

349
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,380
Oh, I ask you today

350
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,600
on Mother's Day,

351
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,700
have confidence

352
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,940
and the word of God,

353
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,260
it's not bound,

354
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
it is not in chains.

355
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,740
Then and only then

356
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,780
will you be willing

357
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,020
to simply,

358
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,600
you will be willing

359
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,440
to submit

360
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,180
and endure anything

361
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,320
for the salvation

362
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,120
of your child

363
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,700
or your children.

364
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,960
Paul wrote to Timothy

365
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,300
because the word of God

366
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,960
is not bound.

367
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,940
Paul says,

368
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,600
I am willing

369
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
to undergo anything

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,220
that the cause

371
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,940
of the gospel

372
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
that men may know

373
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,580
Christ and eternal life.

374
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,500
I ask you

375
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,220
this morning,

376
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,340
Christian Mother,

377
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,380
how far are you

378
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,360
willing to go

379
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,880
in the price

380
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,720
that your children

381
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,480
will grow

382
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,600
in Jesus Christ?

383
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,640
You know,

384
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,520
we all like to see

385
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,300
animal acts,

386
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,740
don't we,

387
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,500
on television?

388
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,220
And I think

389
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,940
most of you know

390
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,120
I've got a dog

391
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
and you may wonder

392
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,540
how come the dogs

393
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,280
can do some of the

394
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,840
wonderful things

395
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,380
that they do.

396
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,720
Do you ever talk

397
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,140
to an animal trainer,

398
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,960
to a dog trainer

399
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,480
and ask him

400
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,640
how this thing happens?

401
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,380
He'll tell you this,

402
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,760
he says,

403
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,920
when you train an animal

404
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,160
or when you train a dog,

405
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,920
there must be

406
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,980
no variations.

407
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,320
It's got to be

408
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,580
the same way

409
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,280
all the time.

410
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,960
My dog's name

411
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,540
is Pumpkin.

412
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,780
I get up early,

413
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,820
far earlier

414
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,580
than most of you,

415
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,180
anywhere from

416
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,440
4.30 to 5,

417
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,220
a little after,

418
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,540
because I can study

419
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,340
in those hours

420
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,600
and you aren't

421
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,180
calling me

422
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,880
at those hours

423
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,480
and I'm not

424
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,440
so much disturbed.

425
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,240
But after studying,

426
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,360
I go down

427
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,340
and I have

428
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,140
a cup of coffee.

429
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,800
My dog,

430
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,200
Pumpkin,

431
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,020
lies there

432
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,960
when I'm drinking

433
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,820
that first cup

434
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,260
of coffee

435
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,500
and he never moves.

436
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
But just as soon

437
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,060
as I get up

438
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,100
and pick up that cup

439
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,220
and go for the second cup,

440
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,220
he's up and he's alert!

441
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,860
Why?

442
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,260
Because he knows

443
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,120
at that time

444
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,320
I wake the missus.

445
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,300
And as long

446
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,220
as that routine

447
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,240
never varies,

448
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,540
just as soon

449
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,480
as I pick up

450
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,040
that cup,

451
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,000
Pumpkin knows,

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,040
that's the time

453
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,440
to awake the missus.

454
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
Have you,

455
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Kristen Mother,

456
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,460
learned to put

457
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,580
first things first?

458
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,220
You know,

459
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,160
in catechism,

460
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,960
I have kids come

461
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,300
and say,

462
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,060
I can't come

463
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,840
to catechism

464
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,620
because I've got

465
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,640
to take a dancing lesson.

466
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,100
We're not arguing

467
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,860
about dancing,

468
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,080
though.

469
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,820
They can't come

470
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,860
because there's

471
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,760
a ball game

472
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,660
or because it's

473
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,740
the swimming lesson

474
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,460
or because

475
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,360
they've got to do this

476
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,340
or they've got

477
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,920
to collect

478
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,980
for their newspapers.

479
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,740
All nice things.

480
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,120
But,

481
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Kristen Mother,

482
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,320
are you willing

483
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,740
to undergo

484
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,600
anything

485
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,820
that you finally

486
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,780
get this thing

487
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,440
straightened out

488
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,180
but first things

489
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,840
come first?

490
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,220
I had an interesting

491
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,140
thing happen

492
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,100
just several months ago.

493
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,860
These kids

494
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,700
that had science displays,

495
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,340
you know,

496
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,160
that they were

497
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,420
to prepare

498
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,240
and some of them

499
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,560
got pretty nice readings

500
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,260
and that meant

501
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,240
some Saturdays.

502
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,340
One of our mothers

503
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,520
told one of the daughters

504
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,800
in the confirmation class

505
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,980
she was not going

506
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,940
on Saturday

507
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,940
because Saturday

508
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,900
was catechism class.

509
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,560
and she was not going

510
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,120
unless

511
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,540
Reverend Hollinson

512
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,880
excused her.

513
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,380
Now,

514
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,300
you may argue,

515
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:31,660
Mother,

516
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,060
and say,

517
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,280
oh,

518
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,100
that mother was

519
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,060
rather extreme

520
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,820
and that mother

521
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,600
was this or that

522
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,020
but listen,

523
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,720
I'd like to assure you

524
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,480
that there is

525
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,140
a daughter

526
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,220
who for the rest

527
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,040
of her life

528
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,900
will remember

529
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,720
that one day

530
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,500
her mother

531
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,320
taught her

532
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
in a great way

533
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,640
that there is

534
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
something bigger

535
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,820
than science displays

536
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,020
as well as they are.

537
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
I think that young lady

538
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,920
learned something.

539
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh,

540
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,240
in case you're interested,

541
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,340
I excused her,

542
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,800
yes.

543
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,420
But I'm just asking you,

544
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,180
Christian mother,

545
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
what comes first

546
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,340
in your family?

547
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Is it Christ

548
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,160
when Sunday comes?

549
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,760
Is it the rule in love

550
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,520
that all of you

551
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,280
are in church

552
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
and you're worshiping?

553
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,880
or is it

554
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,060
the exception?

555
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,160
And when there is

556
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,940
variation,

557
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,900
are you not

558
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,080
screaming aloud

559
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,920
to your child

560
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,100
in the greatest

561
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,060
letters possible?

562
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,360
You don't have

563
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,200
to go to church.

564
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,140
You don't have

565
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,760
to hear the word

566
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,200
of God.

567
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,280
It doesn't make

568
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,920
any difference.

569
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm asking you,

570
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,760
Christian mother,

571
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,800
are you willing

572
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,540
to pay the bill?

573
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,240
What comes first

574
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,480
in your home

575
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,900
and mother?

576
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,400
Oh,

577
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,300
I mean you do it

578
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,860
in love.

579
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,260
In catechism,

580
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,240
one of the tenacious

581
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,960
things I fight for

582
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,020
is that I assure

583
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,220
those kids I love them.

584
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,940
Regardless of what

585
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,360
happens,

586
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,340
I never embarrass

587
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,020
one child.

588
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,780
I love them.

589
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,140
Why?

590
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,340
Because I know

591
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,060
with it all,

592
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,840
if they don't know

593
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,680
that I love them,

594
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,600
I've lost my influence.

595
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,540
and what's worse

596
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,200
than a minister

597
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,420
to lose influence

598
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,820
with the young kids?

599
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,000
You say,

600
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,040
this is Mother's Day.

601
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,060
What shall I say

602
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,600
to you,

603
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,620
Christian mother,

604
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,920
if again,

605
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,840
the great problem

606
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,740
today in our country

607
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,900
is not communism,

608
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,780
but it's

609
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
our young people.

610
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,620
It's a growing

611
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,700
lawlessness,

612
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,440
a growing immorality.

613
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,280
It's a growing

614
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,460
crime wave.

615
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,900
You may say,

616
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,860
how can you

617
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,900
stem the tide?

618
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,640
The Word of God

619
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,720
doesn't seem adequate.

620
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,140
It doesn't seem

621
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,060
to have the zip.

622
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,400
It doesn't have,

623
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:48,980
again,

624
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,040
the effervescence,

625
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,660
the power,

626
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,460
the dynamic,

627
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,160
doesn't it?

628
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,200
Paul says,

629
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,560
I may be in change,

630
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,380
but thank God

631
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,220
the Word of God

632
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,280
is not in change.

633
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
It's not bound.

634
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,460
It's not tethered.

635
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,400
Why don't you know,

636
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,100
Christian mother,

637
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,020
the Holy Spirit

638
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,560
works in the Word of God?

639
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
And I would remind you

640
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,100
that means in the third place

641
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,940
that the Holy Spirit

642
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
still today,

643
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,980
He sharpens by means

644
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,460
of the Word

645
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,440
that conscience

646
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,260
of your child

647
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,060
or your children.

648
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,920
This thing called

649
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,480
conscience,

650
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:19,820
you know,

651
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,860
the Bible tells us

652
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,960
that when God created

653
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,900
our first parents,

654
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,480
He wrote in their hearts

655
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,140
His law,

656
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,160
the knowledge of right

657
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,620
and wrong.

658
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,620
That was conscience.

659
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,400
There was the knowledge

660
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,900
already by creation

661
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,740
inherent in them,

662
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,220
and even though

663
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,180
they fell into sin,

664
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,900
there is a remnant

665
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,700
of that knowledge

666
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,600
within all of us.

667
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,240
all of us

668
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,060
have a conscience,

669
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,320
and we are never

670
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,780
to violate that conscience,

671
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,760
but that conscience

672
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,920
needs to be fed.

673
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
It needs to be sharpened.

674
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,860
Do you realize,

675
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,580
Christian mother,

676
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,680
that when you

677
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,180
fulfill the role

678
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,900
that is yours

679
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,740
as a teacher,

680
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,780
you are the greatest

681
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,800
teacher your child

682
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
will ever have.

683
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,800
You may not be the best,

684
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,700
but you'll be the greatest

685
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,860
because you're there first.

686
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,780
But when you teach

687
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,600
that child,

688
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,300
especially the Ten Commandments,

689
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,800
that the Holy Spirit

690
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
through the law

691
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,820
is sharpening

692
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,680
that conscience

693
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,060
and making it

694
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,860
sensitive

695
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,660
to right and wrong.

696
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
And when the Holy Spirit

697
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,620
makes that conscience

698
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,240
sensitive,

699
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,720
the Holy Spirit

700
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,900
puts into that heart

701
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,660
of your child

702
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,420
or children

703
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,820
a fear of the Lord,

704
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,780
a dread

705
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,860
of doing something wrong.

706
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,180
I ask you this morning,

707
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,160
what more

708
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,520
do you want

709
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,160
the Holy Spirit

710
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,680
to do

711
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,100
than to put

712
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
the fear of the Lord

713
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,000
a sensitive

714
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,120
conscience

715
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,620
by means

716
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,620
of the Word of God

717
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,580
in the heart

718
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,200
of your child

719
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,840
or your children?

720
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,280
You may say,

721
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,600
why isn't it forced?

722
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,760
Because God

723
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
doesn't force morality.

724
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
God made you

725
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,560
and me

726
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,440
with choice.

727
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,000
You know,

728
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,040
a mother called me

729
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,980
one day.

730
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,240
She wanted me

731
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,620
to remonstrate

732
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,380
with her daughter

733
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,440
and ball her out

734
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,460
and this was the reason.

735
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,280
They decided

736
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,160
on Sunday

737
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,880
that they were going

738
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,340
to go on

739
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
a pleasure jaunt.

740
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,220
And the little girl

741
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,640
said,

742
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,100
no,

743
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,240
because I know

744
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
that you will not

745
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,480
be going to church

746
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,360
and I'm going

747
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,120
to church.

748
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,040
And the mother

749
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,640
called me

750
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,200
and she says,

751
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,180
I want you

752
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,320
to tell my daughter

753
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,060
who's boss

754
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,960
in this family,

755
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,280
whether she's boss

756
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,640
or whether I'm boss.

757
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
Then I said

758
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,260
to that mother,

759
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,600
Mother,

760
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,140
far be it from me

761
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,720
to undermine

762
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,860
your authority

763
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,920
as a mother.

764
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,380
But when you want

765
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,300
me to ball out

766
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,900
your daughter

767
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,200
because your daughter's

768
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,180
conscience said

769
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,040
on Sunday

770
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,240
I go to church

771
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,820
and you told her

772
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,520
not to go to church,

773
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,860
we ought rather

774
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
to obey God

775
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,360
rather than man.

776
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,080
Shame on you.

777
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,340
Shame on you.

778
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,540
Shame on you.

779
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,900
Christian mother,

780
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,660
to ask your child

781
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,960
to go against

782
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
her conscience

783
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,520
to do wrong

784
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,640
that you knew

785
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,560
was wrong.

786
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,200
Mother's Day,

787
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,060
boy,

788
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,960
you've got a job,

789
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,520
haven't you?

790
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
You've got a

791
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,580
tremendous job,

792
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,200
your role.

793
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,680
I hope today

794
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,660
that I can write it

795
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,300
on your soul

796
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,960
that there's nothing

797
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,440
wrong with the

798
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,060
Word of God.

799
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
Paul says,

800
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,880
the Word of God

801
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,000
is not in chains,

802
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,000
it's not bound,

803
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
it's not tethered.

804
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,960
There's no reason

805
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,900
in God's world

806
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,560
as far as the

807
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,060
Word of God

808
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,640
is concerned

809
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,340
because the Holy

810
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,380
Spirit works there.

811
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,160
Why your child

812
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,720
or children

813
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,740
must grow up

814
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,540
and live lives

815
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,440
of immorality

816
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
or incest

817
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,160
or lawlessness.

818
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,580
Write it on

819
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,140
your soul

820
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,100
to have confidence

821
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,940
in the Word

822
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,520
and when you

823
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,280
have confidence

824
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
in the Word

825
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,080
then you will

826
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,540
build a reserve

827
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,800
when the day

828
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,760
of crisis comes

829
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,240
and you won't

830
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
be with your kids.

831
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
There came

832
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,800
on the campus

833
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,860
of Kappa University

834
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,840
a new professor

835
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,580
in the Sociology

836
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,160
Department.

837
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,540
I had him

838
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
for Economics.

839
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,480
We became

840
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,460
quite friendly

841
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,600
and since I remained

842
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,320
for seminary

843
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,820
and we lived

844
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,640
in the same building

845
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,260
we became

846
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,540
quite intimate friends

847
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,880
and then I learned

848
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
a bit of his history.

849
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,500
He had been

850
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
in the seminary

851
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,660
of his church

852
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,160
and as sometimes

853
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
happens

854
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,060
he rebelled

855
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,440
against every bit

856
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,640
of it.

857
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,020
He hated God.

858
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,260
He hated Christ.

859
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,480
He was rid

860
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
of all things

861
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,880
that had to do

862
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,380
with religion.

863
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,340
The virgin birth,

864
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
the death of Jesus,

865
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,160
resurrection

866
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,120
meant nothing.

867
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,900
He had thrown

868
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,740
it all over

869
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,540
and gone out

870
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,580
as far as the world

871
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,240
was concerned

872
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
to live with the world.

873
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,580
But he was

874
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,560
a brilliant chap.

875
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,360
Well,

876
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,160
we used to take

877
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,240
walks at night

878
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,300
because that's

879
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,880
what you do.

880
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,740
You had been

881
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,300
at Camp

882
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,060
where you know

883
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,880
how you can walk

884
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,980
up Drexel abroad

885
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,960
and over to Columbia

886
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,000
and down Columbia

887
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,880
and we used to walk

888
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,200
at night

889
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,180
to get the cobwebs

890
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,920
out of our minds.

891
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,200
We took to singing

892
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,280
a couple of nights

893
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
just to be doing

894
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,860
something different.

895
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,760
We sang a number

896
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,320
of hymns

897
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,920
that we sang

898
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,460
and one night

899
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,420
we sang a hymn

900
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,100
that he had learned

901
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,720
as a child

902
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,500
and I had two

903
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,040
in German.

904
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,140
Maybe some of you

905
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,760
know it.

906
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,940
Gott ist die Liebe

907
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,320
er liebt auch mich

908
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,240
drum sag ich

909
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,320
noch einmal

910
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,460
Gott ist die Liebe

911
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,660
er liebt auch mich

912
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,580
God is love

913
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,860
he loves me also.

914
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,300
Well, we sang that

915
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,560
and we'd sing loud

916
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,220
because nobody

917
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,820
was around

918
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,900
and I looked over

919
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,480
at him

920
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,420
and I noticed

921
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,200
he was crying

922
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,320
and I noticed

923
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,840
there were

924
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,080
abundance of tears

925
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,680
coming down

926
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,320
his face

927
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,080
and I looked

928
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,560
over at him

929
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:01,900
and I said

930
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,560
what's wrong?

931
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,680
And he looked

932
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:04,960
at me

933
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,340
and he said

934
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,860
you know

935
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,300
he said

936
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,200
I give up

937
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,720
everything

938
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,400
but he said

939
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,980
there's something

940
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,000
that holds me

941
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,020
my mother

942
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,840
taught me

943
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,800
that song

944
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,480
as a kid

945
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,960
and he said

946
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,020
she couldn't

947
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,680
be wrong

948
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,440
she must have

949
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,960
been right

950
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,120
she believed it

951
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,280
and the only

952
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,800
thing that's

953
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,340
keeping me

954
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,820
from throwing

955
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,740
myself headlong

956
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,260
into the world

957
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,760
he said

958
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,480
is what

959
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,940
my mother

960
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,500
taught me

961
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,160
as a kid

962
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,860
God is

963
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,500
die Liebe

964
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,160
er liebt auch mich

965
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,480
oh

966
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,500
you know

967
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:37,860
the time

968
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,100
is going

969
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,400
to come

970
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,340
you can't

971
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,640
be with

972
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,280
those kids

973
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,040
but oh

974
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,400
God

975
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,780
if you

976
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,200
fulfill

977
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,920
your role

978
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,440
and you

979
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,860
do it

980
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,340
in love

981
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,640
when they

982
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,200
stand up

983
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,760
against the

984
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,040
world

985
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,480
and this

986
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,100
temptation

987
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,900
comes to

988
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,480
lawlessness

989
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,400
and incest

990
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
and immorality

991
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,680
and crime

992
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,840
they can

993
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,400
remember

994
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,960
the word

995
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,560
of God

996
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,300
that you

997
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,380
as their

998
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,860
mother

999
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,440
put into

1000
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,020
their hearts

1001
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,360
and the

1002
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,180
Holy Spirit

1003
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,440
did his

1004
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,940
best

1005
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,720
last August

1006
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,760
I visited

1007
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,520
my mother's

1008
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,020
grave

1009
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,740
and I

1010
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,320
stood there

1011
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,940
and naturally

1012
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,960
I reminisced

1013
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,300
and I went

1014
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,980
back and I

1015
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,740
said to myself

1016
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,520
I can't

1017
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,120
remember a

1018
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,820
time in my

1019
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,280
childhood

1020
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,900
but what my

1021
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,160
mother told

1022
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,640
me I was

1023
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,060
going to be

1024
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,560
a minister

1025
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,860
she literally

1026
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,840
prayed me

1027
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,360
into the

1028
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,800
ministry

1029
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,340
I don't

1030
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,960
remember the

1031
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,580
time but

1032
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,960
what she

1033
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,580
talked to me

1034
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,040
about the

1035
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,360
ministry

1036
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,340
no one ever

1037
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,120
spoke against

1038
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,600
the ministry

1039
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,000
to my

1040
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,320
mother

1041
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,720
if you ever

1042
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,240
wanted to

1043
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,800
tackle the

1044
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,580
wrong person

1045
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,160
just say

1046
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,880
something about

1047
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,400
the ministry

1048
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,760
to my

1049
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:42,960
mother

1050
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,200
and you

1051
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,520
had a

1052
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,860
fight in

1053
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,320
your hands

1054
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,920
that you

1055
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,260
wished you

1056
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,740
had never

1057
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,300
started

1058
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,600
it was

1059
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,120
tenacious

1060
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,180
and I've

1061
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,760
often thought

1062
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,240
to myself

1063
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,880
as I did

1064
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,460
as I stood

1065
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,760
at my

1066
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,100
mother's

1067
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,380
grave

1068
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,800
I wonder

1069
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,120
just what

1070
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,460
would have

1071
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,980
happened to

1072
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,700
me if I

1073
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,260
hadn't been

1074
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,080
prayed into

1075
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,840
the ministry

1076
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,680
God alone

1077
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,460
knows

1078
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,080
but Christian

1079
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,880
mother listen

1080
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,800
if you've

1081
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,620
got a home

1082
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,220
where there's

1083
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,640
love

1084
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,820
and you are

1085
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,980
fulfilling that

1086
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,940
role that God

1087
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,580
gave you

1088
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,340
the greatest

1089
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,180
career in all

1090
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,680
the world

1091
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,800
this word of

1092
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,600
God and you're

1093
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,280
teaching it to

1094
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,980
your kids

1095
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,800
and they have

1096
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,480
learned what

1097
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,200
love is and

1098
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,680
they know how

1099
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,240
to sing

1100
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,160
oh you've

1101
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,100
got it made

1102
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,720
kids like

1103
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,520
to sing

1104
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,960
to their

1105
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,680
mothers on

1106
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680

1107
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,320
and oh what

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,940
a joy to

00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,300
hear them

1110
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,860
sing with

1111
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,360
love

1112
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,560
Jesus loves
