1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Grace and peace be unto you, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,500
The second chapter of the book of Ezekiel.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,680
And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,460
And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet,

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,760
that I heard him that spake unto me.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,660
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,020
to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,360
They and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,860
For they are impudent children and stiff-hearted.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:00,340
I do send thee unto them, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,080
And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious house,

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,340
yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,060
And thou, Son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words,

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,120
though briars and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks,

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,540
though they be a rebellious house.

17
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,100
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear,

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,860
for they are most rebellious.

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,000
But thou, Son of man, hear what I say unto thee.

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,260
Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house.

21
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,220
Open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.

22
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,100
And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me,

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,700
and, lo, a row of a book was therein.

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,920
And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without,

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,820
and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,420
Moreover he said unto me,

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,620
Son of man, eat that thou findest.

28
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,740
Eat this row, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,680
O Lord, open our eyes,

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,140
that we may behold wondrous things out of thy word.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,560
Amen.

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,660
A wonderful thing is happening today in the life of this congregation,

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,820
and in the life of these three men.

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,640
You are not only joining the ranks of the clergy today,

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,240
not just becoming ordained pastors,

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,120
but in many ways you today are joining a company of some very great men.

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,040
In a sense, you walk because you will seek in a special way to do his work

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,820
in the footsteps of Christ himself.

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,280
You also join your feet into the path that has been walked

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,560
by the prophets, Ezekiel, Moses, Isaiah.

41
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,400
Into the path walked by missionaries, Paul and Patrick,

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,720
and Boniface and Livingston and Cary.

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Into the ranks of the martyrs, Peter and Polycarp and John Huss.

44
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,180
The ranks of the preachers,

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,760
Chrysostom and Augustine and Bernard and Luther and Wesley.

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
But most of all today,

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,400
you join the ranks of those thousands upon thousands

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,440
of plain, ordinary pastors

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,340
who without fame and without recognition

50
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,340
have sought to do God's will

51
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,080
where he sent them.

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,240
Today, you join their number.

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,340
And today, in a very calm and ordinary way,

54
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,260
the same thing is happening to you

55
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,040
that happened to each one of them.

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,060
You are being ordained, set apart

57
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,500
for the special work of the Christian ministry.

58
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm sure that in your heart

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
you believe that it is not just the pastors here,

60
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,760
but God himself

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,640
who is ordaining you.

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,360
And therefore, I ask you

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,040
and you people of Emmanuel Lutheran Church

64
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,200
to look at what happened

65
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,520
and what God said

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,340
when he ordained one of his other prophets

67
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,960
into the ministry.

68
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,780
Ezekiel.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,100
Although there may seem to be

70
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,360
very few comparisons

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,380
between your ordination and Ezekiel's,

72
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,540
there is still, I believe, a great deal

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,860
that both you three men

74
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,220
and my good friends

75
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,840
and you, the Christian congregation

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
that has sent them,

77
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
can learn from God

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,640
from this text.

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,800
I wonder if anybody ever received

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,560
a more discouraging call

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,680
than Ezekiel.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,580
You know the words,

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,440
I send thee to the nation of Israel

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,160
to a rebellious house

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,640
that have rebelled against me.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
They and their fathers

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
have transgressed against me

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,300
to this very day.

89
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,920
They are impudent children

90
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,860
and stiff-hearted

91
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,980
and most rebellious.

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,000
How would you feel

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,220
if your calls

94
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,280
from Clifton, Illinois

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,080
and Warren

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,120
and Vickery, Ohio

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,100
had been prefaced

98
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,560
with that kind of a statement

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,500
about your people?

100
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,220
It isn't that we pastors

101
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,500
want a soft touch.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,760
We're not looking for an easy life.

103
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,660
We know the ministry

104
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,980
is not to be that.

105
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,640
Sometimes danger

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,420
and adventure

107
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,400
that even appeals to us

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,260
and draws us

109
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,300
but the promise

110
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,280
of pure hard-heartedness

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,700
that would be most discouraging.

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
And the Lord wasn't just

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,720
making it sound hard

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,440
for Ezekiel

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,000
so that he would work hard.

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,620
The Lord wasn't just

117
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,540
giving Ezekiel

118
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,500
a good psychological treatment

119
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,640
here at his entry

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,540
into the ministry.

121
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,520
Ezekiel's ministry

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,160
proved that every word

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,060
the Lord spoke

124
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,720
was true.

125
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,600
Ezekiel worked

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,120
for 22 years

127
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,300
among the house of Israel

128
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,120
from early morning

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,160
till late at night

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,800
in the temple

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,500
in the streets

132
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,180
at home

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,260
sometimes speaking to them

134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,720
sometimes reproving them

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,700
with no words whatsoever

136
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,940
and his whole ministry

137
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,820
if measured by modern standards

138
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,340
of statistics

139
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,460
and conversions

140
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,500
and baptisms

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,520
and accessions

142
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,860
and money raised

143
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,340
would have been

144
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,980
labeled a miserable failure

145
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,280
from start to finish.

146
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,280
And yet it was the right

147
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,800
place for Ezekiel.

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,400
When the Lord

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,540
ordained him

150
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,660
as one of his prophets

151
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,860
the Lord sent him

152
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,460
to the right place.

153
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,060
It was where God

154
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,780
wanted him.

155
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,840
where a strong man

156
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,420
of God

157
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,380
could be used

158
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,820
a man who didn't

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,040
depend every day

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,820
for his impetus

161
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,900
to do God's work

162
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,620
on a pat on the back

163
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,240
and an encouraging gift

164
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,940
from somebody

165
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,740
who appreciated

166
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,620
what he was doing.

167
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,700
The results show

168
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,580
too that it was

169
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,460
the right place.

170
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,980
God's word

171
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,740
was declared

172
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,700
to those people

173
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,040
even though

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,100
it meant judgment.

175
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,060
And so God

176
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,240
sent Ezekiel

177
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,800
to the right place.

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Isn't it a wonderful

179
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,280
boost

180
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
people of Emmanuel

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
and John

182
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,140
and Jack

183
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,860
and Dick

184
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,540
to your own

185
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,780
faith in God

186
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,340
to see how often

187
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,820
God

188
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,540
in one way

189
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,040
or another

190
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,820
gets just

191
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,080
the right man

192
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,260
to the right place

193
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,520
at the right time.

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,300
You could name

195
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,920
a number of them

196
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,440
in the history

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,080
of the church.

198
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,500
I think you've learned

199
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,180
a little of that

200
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,760
in the past

201
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,460
three years.

202
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,060
How did God

203
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,700
get Paul

204
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,560
to Macedonia?

205
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,720
How did he get

206
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,480
William Carey

207
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,060
to India?

208
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,700
How did he get

209
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,560
the very men

210
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
who brought you

211
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,180
the gospel

212
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,780
who brought

213
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,760
Jesus Christ

214
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,440
to you

215
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,880
and somehow

216
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,000
helped God

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,460
to get him

218
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,300
into your lives

219
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,780
so that

220
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,140
you dedicated

221
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,280
yourselves to him?

222
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,180
How did he get

223
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,860
them to just

224
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,720
the right place

225
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
at the right time?

226
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,460
The men who

227
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,200
nurtured you

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,740
and the women

229
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,840
here in Sunday school.

230
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,420
They don't have

231
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,220
to be pastors

232
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,000
to be called

233
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,640
by God.

234
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
How did they

235
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,860
get right there

236
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,920
at the right time

237
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,860
to produce

238
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,680
this result

239
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,160
today?

240
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,100
It's so common

241
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,640
a thing.

242
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,220
Many of God's

243
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,860
people doing

244
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,600
good work

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,220
for God

246
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,760
right where

247
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,380
they are

248
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,560
that we often

249
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,260
forget it.

250
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,620
And we complain

251
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,740
about those pastors

252
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,600
or those people

253
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,700
who don't do

254
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,240
what God

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,960
gives them to do.

256
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,860
But isn't this

257
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,420
really what

258
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,080
the divinity

259
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,820
of the call

260
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,320
means?

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,700
that God

262
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,960
gets his

263
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,660
people to

264
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,160
where he

265
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,880
wants them

266
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,780
to where

267
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,140
they can

268
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,600
do his

269
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,960
work.

270
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,260
And as you

271
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,980
step into

272
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,500
the ministry

273
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,200
today and

274
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,860
are ordained

275
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,580
by God

276
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,060
that confidence

277
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,820
can fill your

278
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,280
hearts

279
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,680
that of all

280
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,220
the places

281
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,920
in this world

282
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,240
that you

283
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,620
might have

284
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,080
chosen

285
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,060
or where

286
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,480
he might

287
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,900
have sent

288
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,160
you

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,380
he wants

290
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,780
you

291
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,540
John Kerr

292
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,260
among his

293
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,060
people in

294
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,520
Clifton,

295
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:39,940
Illinois.

296
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,560
He wants

297
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,820
you

298
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,260
Jack

299
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,740
Maxim

300
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,100
among his

301
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,560
people

302
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
nowhere else

303
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,620
right now

304
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,040
but in

305
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,440
Warren,

306
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:47,960
Illinois.

307
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,440
He wants

308
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,620
you

309
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:49,880

Williams

311
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,200
not

312
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,740
anywhere

313
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,240
or

314
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,760
everywhere

315
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,420
but he

316
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,820
has a

317
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,220
place

318
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,980
for you

319
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,940

320
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,460
and ready

321
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,840
where you

322
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,400
can serve

323
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,720

in

325
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:58,800
Victory,

326
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,360
Ohio.

327
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,040
There

328
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,860

329
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,260

333
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,900
has been

334
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,260
making

335
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,120
things ready

336
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
not only

337
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,840
those who

338
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,400
are already

339
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,960
his but

340
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,580
those in

341
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,280
those very

342
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,800
places

343
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,040
who haven't

344
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,540
yet heard

345
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,140
his word

346
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,180
he has

347
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,920
been preparing

348
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,480
them for

349
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,040
the ministry

350
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,400
that you

351
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,380
are personally

352
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,340
and specifically

353
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,200
tailored and

354
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,920
prepared by

355
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,480
God to

356
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,740
give.

357
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:23,980
And with

358
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,720
that confidence

359
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,180
you can

360
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,560
go.

361
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,900
In the

362
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,540
confidence of

363
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,100
the psalmist

364
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,540
who said

365
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,040
the steps

366
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,500
of a good

367
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,480
man are

368
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,140
ordered by

369
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,660
the Lord.

370
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,780
Today you

371
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,200
have to

372
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,800
believe it

373
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,960
but if you

374
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,500
enter into

375
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,100
your ministry

376
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,940
leaning on

377
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,820
God's arm

378
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,420
and counting

379
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,880
on his

380
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,380
promise

381
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
the day

382
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,120
will not

383
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,700
be far

384
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,080
off

385
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,060
when you

386
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,460
will not

387
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,160
only have

388
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,700
to believe

389
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,200
it but you

390
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,720
will be able

391
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,240
to see

392
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,140
that it

393
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,740
was so.

394
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,660
That

395
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,400
confidence

396
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,560
unshakable

397
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
can be

398
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,400
yours by

399
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,040
looking at

400
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,100
this word

401
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,760
of God

402
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,660
to Ezekiel

403
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,880
when the

404
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,800
Lord ordained

405
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,640
that prophet

406
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,220
and it's

407
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,980
true when he

408
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,900
ordains you.

409
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,940
But Ezekiel

410
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,760
had no sooner

411
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,400
been told

412
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,180
where to go

413
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,020
then the

414
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,840
Lord also

415
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
made sure

416
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,580
that Ezekiel

417
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,080
would know

418
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,520
what to

419
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,900
say.

420
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,280
He left

421
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,940
Ezekiel

422
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,920
in no doubt

423
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,620
about what

424
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,100
his message

425
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,840
was to be.

426
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,760
I send

427
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,080
you to

428
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,500
them and

429
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:20,900
you shall

430
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,320
say to

431
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,640
them

432
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
thus saith the

433
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Lord God.

434
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,240
You shall

435
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,940
speak my

436
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,600
words unto

437
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,940
them

438
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,860
all my

439
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,520
words that

440
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,020
I speak

441
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,620
unto you.

442
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,140
receive in

443
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,620
your heart

444
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,140
and hear

445
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,560
with your

446
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,180
ears and

447
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,940
go say

448
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,540
to them

449
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,020
thus saith

450
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,520
the Lord

451
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,020
God.

452
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,700
And then

453
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,300
God gave

454
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,340
Ezekiel a

455
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,420
scroll and

456
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,380
made Ezekiel

457
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,020
eat it.

458
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,680
And Ezekiel

459
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,420
when he ate

460
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,840
it said

461
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,140
that it

462
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,560
was as

463
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,320
sweet as

464
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,240
honey in

465
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,760
his mouth.

466
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,640
not

467
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,320
everyone

468
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,220
who is in

469
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,760
the ministry

470
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,620
of God's

471
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,160
church

472
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,840
knows

473
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
clearly and

474
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,620
sounds forth

475
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,180
clearly

476
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,600
the word

477
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
that God

478
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,960
means his

479
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,520
people to

480
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,860
hear.

481
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,460
The Scottish

482
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,900
preacher

483
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,540
Alexander

484
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,180
McLaren

485
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,580
tells about

486
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,000
a church

487
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,580
member who

488
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,160
once came

489
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,660
to him

490
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,480
and said

491
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,820
I heard

492
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,340
sermons

493
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,780
in my

494
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,200
home church

495
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
every Sunday

496
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,280
of my life

497
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,520
and yet

498
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,340
in spite of

499
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,600
that

500
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
thank God

501
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,080
I am still

502
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,620
a Christian.

503
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,080
There are

504
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,800
too many

505
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
as long as

506
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,080
there is even

507
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,900
one in the

508
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,520
ministry of

509
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,260
God's church

510
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,360
there is then

511
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
one too many

512
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,180
if any of

513
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,140
God's prophets

514
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,660
sound forth

515
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
the essential

516
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,260
good news

517
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,780
from God

518
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,080
with an

519
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,040
unclear sound

520
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,000
and as you

521
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
stand today

522
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:48,920
on the

523
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,500
threshold of

524
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,080
your ministry

525
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,100
I think you

526
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,680
are grateful

527
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,060
in your

528
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,580
hearts

529
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,720
that you've

530
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,320
been nurtured

531
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,080
in a church

532
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,400
and prepared

533
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,880
for the

534
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,240
ministry

535
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,820
in a church

536
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,240
where you

537
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,680
have been

538
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,160
taught

539
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,480
that you

540
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,000
are not

541
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,600
to give

542
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,280
people what

543
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,880
happens to

544
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,500
be in your

545
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,160
mind on

546
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,760
every Sunday

547
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,380
morning or

548
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,840
during the

549
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,120
week

550
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
but that you

551
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,620
are called

552
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,220
to break

553
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,920
for them

554
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,760
a message

555
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,380
from God

556
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,820
himself

557
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,560
and you

558
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,020
will not

559
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,520
at every

560
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,060
point when

561
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,480
you open

562
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,960
your mouth

563
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,240
in the

564
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,560
ministry

565
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,080
be able

566
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,600
to say

567
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,680
thus saith

568
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,220
the Lord

569
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
because a

570
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,860
pastor as

571
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,260
he deals

572
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,580
with his

573
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:22,940
people

574
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,900
often

575
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,600
gropes

576
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,320
and hunts

577
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,740
as he

578
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,120
seeks

579
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,060
to meet

580
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,900
their needs

581
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,960
but when

582
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,780
you proclaim

583
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,980
God's word

584
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,940
especially

585
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,660
from the

586
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,180
pulpit of

587
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,140
God's church

588
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,600
then as

589
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,000
you have

590
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,740
been taught

591
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,180
you will

592
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,740
be able

593
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,300
to say

594
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,760
and you

595
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,380
will only

596
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,060
be authorized

597
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,360
to speak

598
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,060
for God

599
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,480
when you

600
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,000
know you

601
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,760
can say

602
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,540
thus saith

603
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,980
the Lord

604
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,540
God

605
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,140
think

606
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,560
you three

607
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,720
and Christian

608
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,220
people

609
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,340
for a moment

610
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,780
about what

611
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,440
it means

612
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,060
to be a

613
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,500
pastor

614
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,200
to stand

615
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,660
Sunday

616
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,480
after Sunday

617
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,160
just to talk

618
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,660
about one

619
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,220
part of it

620
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,300
in a pulpit

621
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,700
every week

622
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,400
to have

623
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,260
before you

624
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,920
scores

625
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,780
or hundreds

626
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,320
of people

627
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,540
each one

628
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,060
of whom

629
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
expect you

630
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,660
to bring

631
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,300
to him

632
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,040
on that

633
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,580
morning

634
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,920
a word

635
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,620
from God

636
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,020
that will

637
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,580
help to

638
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,020
meet the

639
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,360
needs

640
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,760
of his

641
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,020
own

642
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,420
heart

643
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,560
at that

644
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:25,940
moment

645
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,000
there will

646
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,360
be the

647
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,640
young

648
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,060
and the

649
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,400
old

650
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,940
the happy

651
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,320
and the

652
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,780
sad

653
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,180
the forsaken

654
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,840
the lonely

655
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,460
the sinful

656
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,260
the repentant

657
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,900
the indifferent

658
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
the perplexed

659
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,320
every Sunday

660
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,100
you will be

661
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,780
called upon

662
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,380
to speak

663
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,160
helpful

664
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,820
words

665
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,640
from God

666
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,720
to people

667
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,200
who are

668
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,920
as different

669
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,660
as day

670
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,280
is from

671
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,660
night

672
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,740
and many

673
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,220
of whom

674
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,700
will look

675
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,360
up to you

676
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,080
and expect

677
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,580
you to

678
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:48,940
say

679
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,500
there is

680
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,060
God

681
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,280
go that

682
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,780
way

683
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,860
here is

684
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,380
God's

685
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,920
word for

686
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,580
you today

687
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,860
anybody

688
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,760
who going

689
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,160
up the

690
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,740
steps of

691
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,320
the pulpit

692
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,060
does not

693
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,240
feel small

694
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,020
and afraid

695
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,060
is audacious

696
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,040
beyond all

697
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,660
description

698
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,160
that's why

699
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,100
Spencer called

700
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,660
the pulpit

701
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,960
that awful

702
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,580
place

703
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,160
and anybody

704
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,040
who covets

705
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,880
such a calling

706
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
for himself

707
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,980
or enters

708
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,420
into it

709
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,000
thinking that

710
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,920
he is worthy

711
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,160
that he is

712
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,880
God's gift

713
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,520
to the world

714
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:23,960
for this

715
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,400
moment

716
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,300
for whom

717
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,700
everybody

718
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,160
has been

719
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,560
waiting

720
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,960
has pride

721
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,100
beyond belief

722
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,360
any normal

723
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,120
man with

724
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,620
the apostle

725
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,380
Paul would

726
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,800
say

727
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,180
who is

728
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,660
sufficient

729
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,420
for these

730
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,980
things

731
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,540
but there

732
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,980
are the

733
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,380
people

734
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
and they

735
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,440
are waiting

736
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
to be fed

737
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,960
and you

738
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,680
are to bring

739
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,140
them the

740
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,580
food

741
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,060
in such

742
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,800
a situation

743
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,260
it must

744
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,960
be the most

745
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,480
hopeless

746
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
and frustrating

747
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,860
thing

748
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,780
imaginable

749
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,020
to have

750
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,560
only

751
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,520
arguments

752
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,280
various

753
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
points of

754
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,480
views

755
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,740
my particular

756
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,660
ideas for

757
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,300
that week

758
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,480
to have to

759
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,220
lay before

760
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,100
God's people

761
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,800
if that were

762
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
your calling

763
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,700
to bring

764
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,340
forth from

765
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,760
the depth

766
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,120
of your

767
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
own soul

768
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,640
every day

769
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,780
every Sunday

770
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,940
something to

771
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,480
give to the

772
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,840
people

773
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,600
then the

774
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,220
most suitable

775
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,000
text on

776
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,780
your ordination

777
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,540
Sunday would

778
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:17,880
be

779
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,180
God have

780
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,900
mercy on

781
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,220
you

782
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,140
but that's

783
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,640
not your

784
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,120
future

785
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,300
and it's

786
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,120
not mine

787
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,160
and that's

788
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,600
why you

789
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,000
and I

790
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,700
in spite of

791
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,080
what we

792
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,520
are

793
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,320
and in

794
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,720
spite of

795
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:29,900
our

796
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,680
shortcomings

797
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,260
and often

798
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,780
our lack

799
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,340
of faith

800
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,020
and obedience

801
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,500
why we

802
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,180
have the

803
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,800
audacity

804
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,460
to enter

805
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:36,960
into the

806
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,280
pulpit

807
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,920
of God's

808
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,320
church

809
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,940
because there

810
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,720
is still

811
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,400
within his

812
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,820
book

813
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,480
the message

814
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,860
that he

815
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,640
puts on

816
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,480
our lips

817
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
you have

818
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,760
been living

819
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,180
in it

820
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,260
you have

821
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,760
been eating

822
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,440
the scroll

823
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,020
at many

824
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,720
points you

825
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,440
have found

826
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,000
it too

827
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
to be sweet

828
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,320
as honey

829
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,180
although often

830
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,840
as God

831
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,700
prepares you

832
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,240
for it

833
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,680
it also

834
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,400
has bitterness

835
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,140
to it

836
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
and it

837
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,420
bites

838
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:03,880
and it

839
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,380
burns

840
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,500
when it

841
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,940
gets at

842
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,680
some part

843
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,100
in our

844
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,600
lives

845
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,980
that deserves

846
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,360
to be

847
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,680
bitten

848
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,300
and burned

849
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,720
out

850
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,840
but the

851
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,540
word is

852
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,040
there

853
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,500
and it's

854
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,020
much more

855
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,240
than

856
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,780
Ezekiel

857
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,260
saw

858
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,140

862
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,760

863
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,400
powerful

864
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,920
preaching

865
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,380
when it

866
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,980
denounces

867
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,780
their sins

868
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,800
or when it

869
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,360
rakes them

870
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,760
over the

871
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,160
coals

872
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,640
occasionally

873
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,280
someone will

874
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,860
even say

875
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,640
that's real

876
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,620
gospel preaching

877
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,920
well it

878
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,400
isn't

879
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
the gospel

880
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,160

881
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,080
good news

882
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,320

890
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,140

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,940
Lord Tennyson

892
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,500
when he was

893
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,160

894
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,700

895
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,140

899
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,000
says

900
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,920
there's only

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,580

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,960
there have

1029
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,880
been days

1030
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
when men

1031
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,640
and women

1032
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,580
could hardly

1033
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,360
keep their

1034
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,380
voices steady

1035
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,960
when they

1036
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,040
spoke Christ's

1037
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,460
name

1038
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,360
and talked

1039
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,140
about that

1040
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,160
good news

1041
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,180
that's

1042
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,740
your good

1043
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,420

1044
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,100

1045
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,500
what you're

1046
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,060

1047
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,580
proclaim

1048
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,000
that's

1049
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,580
the news

1050
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,200
that God

1051
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,940
brings into

1052
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,860
men's lives

1053
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,240
to make

1054
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,840
them over

1055
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,540
to make

1056
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,260
people his

1057
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,760
children

1058
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,340
that's

1059
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,900
the news

1060
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,720
that God

1061
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,460
equips you

1062
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,940
with as

1063
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,740
your message

1064
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,320
today when

1065
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,020
he ordains

1066
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,180
you into

1067
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,000
his ministry

1068
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,200
saint

1069
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,740
bernard

1070
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,160
the great

1071
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,540
preacher

1072
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,800
of the

1073
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,180
medieval

1074
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,780
age

1075
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,820
said that

1076
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,100
when he

1077
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,420
preached

1078
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:24,880
his own

1079
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,440
ideas

1080
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,140
people

1081
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,460
invariably

1082
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,040
praised

1083
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,380
him

1084
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,160
but when

1085
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,720
he preached

1086
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,460
that good

1087
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,140
news

1088
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,860
then sinners

1089
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,440
came up

1090
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,980
to thank

1091
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,280
him

1092
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,940
so to

1093
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,500
preach

1094
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,640
not that

1095
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,260
people will

1096
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,040
praise you

1097
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,420
but so that

1098
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,140
sinners will

1099
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,980
find the good

1100
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,600
news and

1101
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
thank God

1102
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,120
that's your

1103
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,580
calling

1104
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,760
and a man

1105
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,380
doesn't learn

1106
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,760
that in

1107
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,380
four years

1108
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,140
of seminary

1109
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,280
he doesn't

1110
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,780
learn it in

1111
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,320
ten years

1112
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,560
of the

1113
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,000
ministry

1114
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,280
there's no

1115
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,160
quick overnight

1116
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,920
course in

1117
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,440
which you can

1118
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,880
learn it

1119
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,920
you will be

1120
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,680
eating that

1121
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,600
scroll for

1122
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,380
yourself of

1123
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,340
God's gospel

1124
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,240
every day

1125
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,880
as long as

1126
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,300
you live

1127
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,240
every week

1128
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,460
as you seek

1129
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,120
to break the

1130
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,800
good news to

1131
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,560
God's people

1132
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,420
and when you

1133
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,060
do that

1134
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,320
people will

1135
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,000
hear it

1136
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,420
as you have

1137
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,960
heard it

1138
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,100
and you

1139
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,600
will know

1140
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,100
you do

1141
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,640
not have

1142
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,260
the option

1143
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,000
of believing

1144
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,660
it or not

1145
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,540
believing it

1146
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,260
because you

1147
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,020
will hear your

1148
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,120
almighty maker

1149
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,860
and lord

1150
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,600
speaking it

1151
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,120
to you

1152
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,380
and it will

1153
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,860
fill your

1154
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,220
heart

1155
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,080
and you

1156
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,560
will say

1157
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,620
thank God

1158
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:30,980
that he

1159
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,600
brought into

1160
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,280
my life

1161
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,500
the good

1162
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,100
news

1163
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,680
but to

1164
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,440
proclaim it

1165
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,700
you not

1166
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,400
only have to

1167
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,760
be in the

1168
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,480
right place

1169
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,020
where God

1170
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,600
sends you

1171
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:41,940
and know

1172
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,360
the right

1173
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,880
message

1174
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,260
it takes a

1175
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,600
little bit

1176
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,100
more than

1177
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,560
that

1178
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,160
it needs

1179
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,980
the right

1180
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,740
kind of a

1181
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,080
spirit

1182
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,140
people have

1183
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,680
a strange

1184
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,120
notion

1185
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,880
sometimes

1186
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,560
even today

1187
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,180
sometimes

1188
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,640
about the

1189
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,100
ministry

1190
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,620
as if the

1191
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,600
shy

1192
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,260
quiet

1193
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
unsociable

1194
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,720
backward

1195
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,220
boy

1196
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,500
who likes

1197
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,180
books above

1198
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,780
all else

1199
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,240
and has never

1200
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,720
been in a

1201
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,100
speck of

1202
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,560
trouble in

1203
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,020
his life

1204
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,980
is the

1205
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,240
best

1206
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,720
candidate

1207
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,160
for the

1208
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,580
ministry

1209
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:09,980
if that

1210
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,400
were true

1211
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,860
I doubt

1212
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,520
whether John

1213
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,000
or Jack

1214
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,400
or Dick

1215
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,800
would be

1216
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,580
being ordained

1217
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,040
today

1218
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
but people

1219
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,600
still get

1220
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,260
that idea

1221
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,840
don't they

1222
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,320
but let

1223
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,800
some

1224
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,520
robust

1225
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,260
live

1226
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,000
courageous

1227
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,760
gregarious

1228
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,340
intelligent

1229
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,960
boy come

1230
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,360
along

1231
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,100
who's in

1232
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,620
his share

1233
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,100
of trouble

1234
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,340
but who has

1235
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,220
a good mind

1236
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,860
and lots of

1237
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,240
ability

1238
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,900
and who gives

1239
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,540
promise of

1240
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,060
being able

1241
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,240
to lay up

1242
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,920
plenty of

1243
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,660
this world's

1244
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,000
treasure

1245
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,920
and very

1246
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,540
few people

1247
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,020
will tell

1248
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,280
him

1249
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,520
son

1250
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,340
do you

1251
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,540
think

1252
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:40,840
maybe

1253
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,280
God

1254
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,940
is calling

1255
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,380
you

1256
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,940
into the

1257
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,380
ministry

1258
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,200
as if

1259
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,780
the ministry

1260
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,500
is a refuge

1261
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,040
for the

1262
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,900
maladjusted

1263
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,140
a quiet

1264
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,800
sheltered

1265
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,340
life for

1266
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,900
cowards

1267
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,160
a refuge

1268
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,900
for those

1269
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,440
who can't

1270
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,880
succeed

1271
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,020
anywhere else

1272
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,640
well you

1273
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,120
know better

1274
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,780
than that

1275
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,160
and Ezekiel

1276
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,780
surely knew

1277
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,300
better than

1278
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,680
that

1279
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,460
because God

1280
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:02,920
said to

1281
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,500
Ezekiel

1282
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
your task

1283
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,700
is difficult

1284
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,180
and it

1285
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,580
takes a

1286
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,280
good man

1287
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,460
and like

1288
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:08,900
Jeremiah

1289
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,780
and Moses

1290
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,360
I'm sure

1291
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,900
Ezekiel

1292
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,720
protested

1293
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,060
and said

1294
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,660
Lord I'm

1295
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:12,980
not a

1296
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,400
good enough

1297
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,880
man

1298
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,720
for that

1299
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,100
work

1300
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,780
and then

1301
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,320
the Lord

1302
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,980
when he

1303
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,520
ordained

1304
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,140
Ezekiel

1305
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,840
into that

1306
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,340
calling

1307
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,980
gave to

1308
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,640
Ezekiel

1309
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,020
the right

1310
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,560
spirit

1311
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,960
and he

1312
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,460
said do

1313
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,920
not be

1314
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,480
afraid of

1315
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,740
them

1316
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,800
though

1317
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,320
briars

1318
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,940
and thorns

1319
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,440
are with

1320
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,660
you

1321
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,980
and you

1322
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,400
live with

1323
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
scorpions

1324
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
don't be

1325
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,080
afraid of

1326
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,740
their words

1327
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,320
or their

1328
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,840
looks

1329
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,520
whether they

1330
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,220
hear or

1331
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,940
don't hear

1332
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,620
just remember

1333
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,840
whether they

1334
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,060
hear or

1335
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,900
don't hear

1336
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,440
yet they

1337
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,100
will know

1338
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,520
that there

1339
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,080
has been a

1340
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,940
prophet among

1341
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,280
them

1342
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,560
now our

1343
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,280
calling isn't

1344
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,120
like Ezekiel

1345
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,580
you don't

1346
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,040
go to a

1347
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,940
rebellious house

1348
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,680
of whom God

1349
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,320
says that

1350
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,460
you go to a

1351
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,540
Christian congregation

1352
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,020
sure there

1353
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,480
are hard

1354
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,120
hearted people

1355
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,580
around

1356
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,840
but the

1357
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,420
spirit that

1358
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,100
God gives

1359
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,680
you and me

1360
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,180
upon our

1361
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,680
entry into

1362
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,240
the ministry

1363
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,420
or you

1364
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,160
his servant

1365
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,060
in the work

1366
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,680
that he calls

1367
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,200
you to do

1368
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,860
wherever you

1369
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,260
are

1370
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
is not

1371
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,060
first of all

1372
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,620
the spirit

1373
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,220
of a hard

1374
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,620
head

1375
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,160
it's the

1376
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,960
spirit of a

1377
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,460
soft

1378
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,520
great heart

1379
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,700
and that

1380
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,260
spirit

1381
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,620
tailored to

1382
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,300
your ministry

1383
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
God also

1384
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,260
offers to

1385
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,820
you the

1386
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,640
holy spirit

1387
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,300
you won't

1388
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,760
be called

1389
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,360
upon like

1390
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,040
Ezekiel to

1391
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,600
lie on your

1392
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
left side

1393
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,380
for 390

1394
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,140
days as a

1395
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,740
rebuke to

1396
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,220
the people

1397
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,520
read Ezekiel

1398
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,940
the third

1399
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,840
chapter again

1400
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,660
sometime and

1401
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,100
see what he

1402
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,780
was called to

1403
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,860
do or to

1404
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,400
lie on your

1405
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,060
right side

1406
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,620
for 40

1407
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,500
days or to

1408
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,320
stand against

1409
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,160
a nation

1410
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,980
every one of

1411
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,400
whom was

1412
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,160
against you

1413
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,540
but you'll be

1414
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,340
called upon to

1415
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,140
weep with those

1416
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,820
who weep

1417
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,240
and rejoice

1418
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,920
with those

1419
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,760
who rejoice

1420
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,240
to bear with

1421
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,660
the weak

1422
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,600
to reprove the

1423
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,280
hard hearted

1424
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,040
to forgive the

1425
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,180
sinner even

1426
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,060
before he wants

1427
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,820
to be forgiven

1428
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,140
to be patient

1429
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,540
with the

1430
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,960
struggling

1431
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,660
to help the

1432
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
blind to see

1433
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,680
to help the

1434
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,300
fearful to

1435
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,800
trust

1436
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,140
the lazy to

1437
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,520
serve

1438
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,140
the selfish

1439
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,800
to give

1440
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,080
to be so

1441
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,100
sensitive to

1442
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,740
God and to

1443
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,340
his people

1444
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,020
that you know

1445
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,100
when love will

1446
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,800
prompt you to

1447
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,540
be firm and

1448
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,300
unyielding

1449
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,980
when love

1450
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,580
will prompt

1451
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:24,940
you to

1452
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,580
speak and

1453
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,120
when love

1454
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,680
will seal

1455
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,400
your lips

1456
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,960
in silence

1457
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,460
you'll be

1458
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,440
called upon

1459
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,000
to the kind

1460
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,480
of life

1461
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,780
and the

1462
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,140
spirit

1463
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,420
that will

1464
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:34,820
be able

1465
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,440
to discern

1466
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,220
when love

1467
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,700
makes you

1468
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,220
denounce

1469
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,720
evil

1470
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,340
and when

1471
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,140
love causes

1472
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,600
you to go

1473
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,080
the tenth

1474
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,560
mile

1475
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,760
and to

1476
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,180
turn the

1477
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,880
other cheek

1478
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,060
where will

1479
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,340
you get

1480
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,020
that spirit

1481
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,420
where do

1482
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,760
you get

1483
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,320
the spirit

1484
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,900
so that in

1485
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,620
your ministry

1486
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,780
whether they

1487
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,260
hear

1488
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,140
or refuse

1489
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,680
to hear

1490
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,040
yet they

1491
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,680
will know

1492
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,100
that there

1493
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,460
has been

1494
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,940
a prophet

1495
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,600
among them

1496
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,180
same place

1497
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,000
Ezekiel got

1498
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,240
it

1499
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,620
same place

1500
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,420
everybody has

1501
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,100
to get it

1502
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,260
so take hold

1503
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,900
of the promise

1504
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,240
again

1505
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,120
you'll need it

1506
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,720
over and over

1507
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,240
again

1508
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,060
every day

1509
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,680
every week

1510
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,440
in your ministry

1511
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,720
like Pastor

1512
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,660
Hollinson does

1513
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,500
and every other

1514
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,840
man who seeks

1515
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,720
to do God's work

1516
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,540
take hold of the

1517
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,360
promise that it's

1518
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,680
there

1519
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,180
if you

1520
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,920
being evil

1521
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,560
know how to

1522
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,020
give good

1523
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,720
gifts to your

1524
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,140
children

1525
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,400
how much

1526
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,020
more will

1527
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,540
your heavenly

1528
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,280
father give

1529
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,740
the Holy

1530
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,220
Spirit

1531
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,440
to them

1532
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,960
that ask

1533
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,280
him

1534
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,540
and people

1535
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,140
of Emmanuel

1536
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,240
don't let

1537
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,020
these three

1538
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,480
men

1539
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,780
go out

1540
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,240
from your

1541
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,680
midst

1542
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,420
into the

1543
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,860
ministry

1544
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,180
and then

1545
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
forget them

1546
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,100
you have a

1547
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,000
role in their

1548
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,580
ministry

1549
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,380
almost as

1550
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,180
important as

1551
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,860
theirs

1552
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,780
how about the

1553
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,420
other seven

1554
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,380
from Emmanuel

1555
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,060
who went into

1556
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,680
the ministry

1557
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,040
are they being

1558
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,060
supported day

1559
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,680
by day

1560
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,140
and week

1561
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,740
by week

1562
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,840
with the

1563
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,500
prayers of

1564
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,960
Emmanuel

1565
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
they didn't

1566
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,980
go into the

1567
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,640
ministry for

1568
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,260
themselves

1569
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,780
you know

1570
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,240
they went in

1571
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,020
for God

1572
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,260
and for you

1573
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,820
do you pray

1574
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,240
for them

1575
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,720
in Sunday

1576
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,140
school

1577
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,960
do you pray

1578
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,400
for them

1579
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,020
in church

1580
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,520
do you pray

1581
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,100
for them

1582
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,340
in the privacy

1583
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,980
of your own

1584
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,380
homes

1585
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,040
in your church

1586
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,800
organizations

1587
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,900
do you support

1588
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,160
them by asking

1589
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,680
God

1590
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,020
Lord we don't

1591
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,460
know anything

1592
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,020
about their

1593
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,620
difficulties

1594
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,360
but we know

1595
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,200
to be a prophet

1596
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,740
of God

1597
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,460
takes your

1598
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:35,920
spirit

1599
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,300
Lord

1600
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,060
whatever their

1601
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,620
needs

1602
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,980
this week

1603
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,500
give them

1604
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,940
the measure

1605
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,540
of the spirit

1606
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,060
they need

1607
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,580
to fulfill

1608
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:42,820
it

1609
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,740
it's your

1610
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,280
ministry

1611
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,100
that they

1612
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,740
are seeking

1613
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,500
to fulfill

1614
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,460
do not

1615
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,120
renege

1616
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,720
on your

1617
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,700
part in it

1618
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,160
by forgetting

1619
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,820
how you

1620
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,620
support their

1621
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,080
hands

1622
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,660
and how you

1623
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,120
can help

1624
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,900
God's spirit

1625
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,460
come into

1626
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,780
them

1627
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,180
today the

1628
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,620
Lord is

1629
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,520
ordaining you

1630
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,100
as his

1631
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,560
prophets

1632
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,680
can you

1633
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,200
take from

1634
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,760
Ezekiel

1635
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,240
this

1636
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,940
encouragement
