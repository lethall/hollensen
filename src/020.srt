1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Peace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,540
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written back in the Old Testament.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,060
The book of Jeremiah, the 8th chapter, beginning at the 4th verse.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,420
Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord,

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,240
Shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and not return?

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,560
Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,380
They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,220
I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,420
No man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,220
Every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,240
Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times,

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,040
And the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming.

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,360
But my people know not the judgment of the Lord.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,640
How do ye say we are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us?

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,860
Lo, certainly in vain made he it.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,220
The pen of the scribes is in vain.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,000
The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,980
Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord.

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,820
And what wisdom is in them?

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,800
And now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight.

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,360
O Lord, our strength and our redeemer.

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,240
Amen.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,440
Good morning, dear friends in Christ Jesus,

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,480
you who are here in God's house,

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,060
and you also, Christian friends, who are worshipping with us by means of the radio.

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,820
The prophet Jeremiah lived about 600 years before Jesus came into the world.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,260
He was the prophet, the preacher that God used for the southern kingdom of Judah.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,620
We may say to ourselves this morning,

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,800
what was going on amongst the people in the smaller kingdom,

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
that of the kingdom of Judah?

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,760
Well, it was just like this.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,340
The people in the southern kingdom, for the most part,

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,200
had turned away from God,

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,360
and they had turned to wickedness.

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,740
They had turned to worldly, sinful pleasures,

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,260
and they refused to repent.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,540
And the reason was simple.

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,640
They were having too much fun in serving the world

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,420
in its willful and wicked pleasures.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,540
What kind of a message could God give to people

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,340
who had turned against him to the world

42
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,920
and who were enjoying it to the very nth degree?

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,560
God told Jeremiah that he was to say this to them,

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
thus saith the Lord.

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,360
He said,

46
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,600
Tell them this.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,060
Will they fall and not arise?

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,180
Will he turn away and not return?

49
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,220
In other words,

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,780
God said,

51
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,600
Jeremiah, you tell my people this,

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,820
and ask them this question.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,540
What do you think about a man who falls down

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,120
and who doesn't get up again?

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,740
Now, this is a man that falls.

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,780
He doesn't hurt himself,

57
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,600
but he falls and he just lies there.

58
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,360
And I'm sure the people of Judah told Jeremiah,

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
A man that falls down

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,820
that doesn't have sense enough to get up

61
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,900
is just plain stupid.

62
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,700
He's a fool.

63
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,700
After all, that's idiotic.

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,760
If you fall down and you're not hurt,

65
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,060
you'll get yourself up again.

66
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,020
And then Jeremiah was to say,

67
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,300
What do you think about a man

68
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,160
who gets on the wrong road

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,640
and finds out that he's on the wrong road

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,440
when he's traveling?

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,980
But he refuses to get back on the right road.

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
And I'm sure that the people of Judah

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,060
told Jeremiah when he asked him that question,

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,940
Well, any man that's on the wrong road

75
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,640
and knows it,

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,220
and there's the right road

77
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,420
and doesn't get back on,

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,660
he's just plain foolish.

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,100
He's a stupid fool.

80
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,700
That's all you can say for him.

81
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,360
And then Jeremiah said,

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,040
And this is what God says to you,

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,720
Why then is this people of Jerusalem

84
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,680
slitting back with a perpetual backsliding?

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,260
Why do they refuse to return?

86
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,720
In other words, God said,

87
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,480
You tell the people of Judah this,

88
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,000
Jeremiah,

89
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,080
that because they refuse to repent,

90
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,240
because they refuse to turn away from the world

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,140
and from the wickedness of sinful pleasures

92
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,460
and come back to me,

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,260
you tell them that this is the height of stupidity,

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,440
this is the height of foolishness,

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,180
this is the height of idiocy.

96
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,140
But they didn't believe it

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,040
because they were having too much fun.

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,800
And we in the 20th century,

99
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,060
we may say when God brings this message

100
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,400
that he had Jeremiah give to the people

101
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,240
of the southern kingdom

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
and brings it to us this morning,

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
we may say to ourselves,

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,380
What is our answer?

105
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,480
When God says,

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,760
If they fall,

107
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,420
shall they not arise?

108
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,980
And on the basis of that,

109
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,940
you and I would say this to God,

110
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,740
Any fellow that falls down,

111
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,240
isn't hurt,

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,320
and just lies there

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,340
and stays there

114
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,820
is just a plain stupid fool.

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,180
He hasn't got the sense

116
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,480
God gave a jackass.

117
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,960
There's something wrong with him.

118
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,220
There is something.

119
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,780
He's lost these buttons.

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,620
There is nonsense in any man

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,940
that would fall down and stay there.

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,980
And we'd say the same to God.

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,500
If God said,

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,520
What do you think about a man

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,060
who gets on the wrong road

126
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,820
and finds out he's on the wrong road

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,500
and doesn't go back?

128
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,420
You and I would say,

129
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,980
Well, that fellow's a stupid fool.

130
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,180
He hasn't got the brains God gave him.

131
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,580
He's lost what few he's got,

132
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,260
wouldn't we?

133
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,260
But when God says to you and me,

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,520
If again we refuse to repent

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,700
and we have turned away

136
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,800
from Jesus Christ

137
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,480
and we have turned

138
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,860
to the wickedness of the world

139
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,960
and we have turned

140
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
to worldly pleasures

141
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
and we refuse to repent,

142
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,820
if God says to you and me

143
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,400
this morning,

144
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:37,860
Therefore,

145
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,680
this is the height of stupidity

146
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,580
on your part.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,180
This is utter foolishness.

148
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,340
This is utter nonsense.

149
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,600
This is unreasonableness.

150
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,640
This is ridiculousness.

151
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,700
At its worst.

152
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,840
Then you and I sort of stop,

153
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,320
don't we?

154
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,800
And we'd say,

155
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
Well, I'm not too sure about that.

156
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,700
I don't know whether this is

157
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,360
the height of stupidity.

158
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,360
And we may say,

159
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,860
Maybe this is the height of wisdom.

160
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,280
And we may say,

161
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,280
Like you and of old,

162
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,720
You know,

163
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,520
there's a lot of fun

164
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
lying down there

165
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,340
when you think about it

166
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,260
if you're going to connect it

167
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,100
with the way we live.

168
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,740
Why shouldn't I lie down there?

169
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,420
Why shouldn't I stay

170
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,600
on the wrong road?

171
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
There's more fun

172
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,360
lying down there.

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,580
There's more fun

174
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,720
on the wrong road

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
than there is

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,780
in serving Jesus Christ

177
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,580
as Lord and Savior.

178
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,400
Doesn't God know that?

179
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,840
And yet,

180
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,100
God says to you and me,

181
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,560
If we refuse to repent

182
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,620
and to turn away

183
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,660
from the world

184
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,240
and worldly sinful pleasures,

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
God says,

186
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,860
This is just as foolish.

187
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,320
It is just as stupid

188
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,460
as the man that falls down

189
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,640
who isn't hurt

190
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,220
and just refuses

191
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,860
to get up again.

192
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,100
Or the man on the wrong road

193
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,020
that knows it

194
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,040
and just refuses

195
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,320
to get on the right road.

196
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
And God says

197
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,740
it's the height of stupidity

198
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,860
because God insists

199
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,180
there is more fun,

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
there is more joy

201
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
in following Jesus

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
than there is

203
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,640
in following

204
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,940
the world.

205
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,040
Do you really believe that?

206
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,960
You may say to me this morning,

207
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,620
That it would be a hard thing,

208
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:19,960
fellow,

209
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,820
for you to prove

210
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,220
that there's more fun,

211
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,920
more unadulterated joy

212
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,580
in following Christ

213
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,160
than there is

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,500
in following

215
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,780
and indulging

216
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,280
in the wickedness

217
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,140
of the world

218
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,540
with its worldly pleasures.

219
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,340
You may say,

220
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,700
You'll have a hard job

221
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,960
proving that to me,

222
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,320
but I'd like to try

223
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,660
because God is convinced

224
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,880
there's more fun

225
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,520
in following Jesus

226
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,020
than in following the world

227
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,500
because in the first place,

228
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,300
God reminds you and me

229
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,020
of that wickedness,

230
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,780
of that worldly sinful desires

231
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
and pleasures

232
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,860
do bring joy,

233
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,620
but at best only temporary,

234
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,620
followed by endless,

235
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,160
unsatisfying craving.

236
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,940
I'd be insane myself

237
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,460
to say to you this morning

238
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,380
that there's no fun

239
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,300
in worldliness,

240
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,140
in wickedness.

241
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,340
Why, if there was no fun

242
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,420
in immorality,

243
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,520
if there was no fun

244
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,780
in drunkenness,

245
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,800
if there was no fun

246
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,560
in taking LSD

247
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
and taking the trip,

248
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,060
then why do millions do it?

249
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,840
Temptation,

250
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,820
when it comes to you and me,

251
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,460
always offers fun

252
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,360
and pleasure

253
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,180
it did to Eve

254
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,420
back in the Garden of Eden.

255
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,580
Satan said,

256
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,720
If you eat of this fruit,

257
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,960
you're going to be like God.

258
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,700
And Adam and Eve

259
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,940
wanted to be like God.

260
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,460
They thought that was a lot of fun.

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,520
And therefore,

262
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,100
when the world says,

263
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,560
Here is fun.

264
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,960
Fun's in immorality.

265
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,020
Fun's in getting plastered.

266
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,180
Fun is in taking the trip.

267
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,980
That's true.

268
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,020
There is.

269
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,360
You mean there's no fun

270
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,320
in looking at pictures

271
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,660
of beautiful women

272
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
in go-go girls

273
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,440
that are naked

274
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
from the waist on up?

275
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,920
Do you mean there's no fun

276
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,760
in adultery?

277
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,540
Do you mean that there's no fun

278
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,600
in fornication?

279
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,980
Why, of course there's fun.

280
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,580
Well, that's why millions

281
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,640
have turned to it.

282
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,300
God doesn't deny that.

283
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,140
But it's only temporary fun.

284
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,160
What about sexuality?

285
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
What about immorality?

286
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,520
Let a couple get married

287
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,780
and let it be on the basis

288
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,840
of sexuality

289
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,720
that he is a handsome Greek god

290
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,560
and she is no less than

291
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,580
a beautiful Greek goddess.

292
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,740
And if it's based only on sexuality,

293
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,500
I give them six months at the most.

294
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,100
Because in six months,

295
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
the thrill of that kind of joy

296
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,420
is over with.

297
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,260
That's the wife that comes in

298
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,760
after six months and says,

299
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
I don't want my husband to touch me.

300
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,260
I have lost all love for him.

301
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,920
There is no joy.

302
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,180
There is no thrill.

303
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
And that's the case

304
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,100
when the husband comes in

305
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,560
and says,

306
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,600
somehow or other,

307
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,680
I'm impotent.

308
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,740
Somehow or other,

309
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,340
I've lost my manliness.

310
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,300
I have no joy

311
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
in my wife whatsoever.

312
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,200
It's gone.

313
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,700
Why?

314
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,540
Because God made you and me.

315
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,440
That with what the world

316
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,340
has to offer

317
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,200
in sexuality and immorality

318
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,260
and in getting plastered

319
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,040
or in taking a trip,

320
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,100
it brings joy,

321
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,060
but it doesn't last.

322
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,080
There comes, therefore,

323
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,140
the only answer,

324
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
promiscuity.

325
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,200
So you've got to go out

326
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,840
and you've got to seek joy

327
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,380
in somebody else.

328
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,320
And on and on it goes.

329
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,160
And what happens

330
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,380
when promiscuity comes in sexuality?

331
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,400
I was in a government

332
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,820
veterans' hospital

333
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,120
not too long ago.

334
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,140
Over 2,000 men there.

335
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,840
And I asked the officer

336
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
that I was with,

337
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,340
why are these men here?

338
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,900
Believe it or not,

339
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,940
this was the answer

340
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,160
and it shocked me.

341
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,080
He said,

342
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,260
over 99%

343
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,020
of these more than 2,000

344
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,580
are here

345
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,980
because they have been bad boys.

346
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,860
They have syphilis.

347
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,940
Syphilis has gotten

348
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,860
into their bodies

349
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,060
and it's gotten

350
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,280
into their brains

351
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,840
and there is

352
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,920
softening of the brain.

353
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,960
A locomotor ataxia.

354
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,340
And you doctors

355
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,180
tell me that

356
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,440
in the venereal disease

357
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,820
that a man can have

358
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,080
a syphiletic infection

359
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,480
and he can go out

360
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,200
in promiscuity.

361
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,340
He can get another infection

362
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,640
on top of that one.

363
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And it eats out

364
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
a man's mind.

365
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,820
It eats out

366
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,360
his nervous system.

367
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
You mean to say

368
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,180
that there's a lot of fun

369
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,840
in sexuality

370
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,920
and immorality?

371
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080
I had a man

372
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,800
in my office

373
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,520
one day

374
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
in this idea

375
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,040
of being drunk

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,760
to try to satisfy

377
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,140
this thing

378
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,820
drinking two-fifths a day.

379
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,760
I've never seen

380
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,060
a man more filled

381
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,720
with alcohol

382
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,940
and yet able

383
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,700
to talk.

384
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,340
The representative

385
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,260
of the local AA

386
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,980
told me that

387
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,740
he stands

388
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,500
as a monument.

389
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,640
Nearly a half

390
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,540
a gallon of whiskey

391
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,660
in 24 hours.

392
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,180
And still standing

393
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,280
sober in a body

394
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,000
screaming for more

395
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,100
because it never

396
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
satisfies.

397
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,820
And God alone

398
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,860
knows in the

399
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,240
taking of the acid

400
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,100
as it's called

401
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,040
and in this trip

402
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
just what comes.

403
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,920
I walked into

404
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,260
the hospital one day

405
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,780
and the nurse

406
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,340
said to me

407
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,860
whispered

408
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,120
don't touch that bed.

409
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,060
That woman has syphilis.

410
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,660
Watch it.

411
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,900
When you go

412
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,180
into some rest homes

413
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,740
and you see

414
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,040
a man 80 years old

415
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
and his hands

416
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,800
are tied

417
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,560
to keep him

418
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,180
from playing

419
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,940
with himself

420
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,600
you and I

421
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,300
say to ourselves

422
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,000
what fun

423
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,780
when we look

424
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,500
to the world

425
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,680
and the world

426
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,500
says come on

427
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,220
this is the way

428
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,780
to live.

429
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Let joy

430
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,300
be unconfined

431
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,120
as

432
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,460
Jeremiah

433
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,580
told the people

434
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,080
of Judah

435
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
you'll rush

436
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,160
into it

437
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,820
like a horse

438
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,720
going into battle

439
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
unbridled.

440
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,140
you mean

441
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,620
to say

442
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,340
there's more

443
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,800
fun

444
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,620
when a woman

445
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,120
called me

446
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,600
one day

447
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,360
and she says

448
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,380
a man

449
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,840
going through

450
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,420
the backyard

451
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,820
and I have

452
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,300
my underwear

453
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,040
on the line

454
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,080
he's showing

455
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,000
my underwear

456
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,360
you say

457
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,080
for God's

458
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,240
sakes

459
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,900
what gets

460
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,640
into men

461
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,780
and men

462
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,240
who can't

463
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,560
keep their

464
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,060
hands off

465
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,280
of their

466
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,920
own children

467
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,660
that's fun

468
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,740
nobody denies

469
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,800
that the world

470
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,860
offers fun

471
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,800
but take it

472
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,420
from God

473
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,140
it's temporary

474
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,840
and it leaves

475
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,540
a craving

476
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,220
that is endless

477
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,700
that's hell

478
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,760
hell is the

479
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,960
endless craving

480
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,040
for the wickedness

481
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,700
of the world

482
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,200
that will never

483
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,940
be satisfied

484
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,920
in hell

485
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
then you say

486
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,940
what fun

487
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,380
is there in

488
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,120
Jesus Christ

489
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,880
may I just

490
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,660
say this

491
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,900
the fun

492
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,180
of being rid

493
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,660
and not

494
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,540
having that

495
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,680
the fun

496
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,140
of having

497
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,660
a decent

498
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,240
mind

499
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,900
and a sound

500
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,420
body

501
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
the mind

502
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,800
of not

503
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
trying to

504
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,120
satisfy

505
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,140
the wants

506
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,920
of the soul

507
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,980
where it

508
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,700
can't be

509
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,360
satisfied

510
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,020
the joy

511
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,060
and the fun

512
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,460
of self

513
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,980
discipline

514
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,720
in Jesus

515
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Christ

516
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
the fun

517
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,200
of being

518
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,820
able to

519
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,300
say

520
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,320
no

521
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,700
God

522
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,420
in this

523
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,300
20th century

524
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,220
speaks to you

525
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,740
and me

526
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,140
in the message

527
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,740
that he gave

528
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,280
to Jeremiah

529
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,120
when he said

530
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,640
to Jeremiah

531
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,760
you ask them

532
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,060
shall they fall

533
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,080
and not arise

534
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,220
what about a man

535
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,140
that falls down

536
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,720
who isn't hurt

537
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,040
and just lies there

538
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,080
he's stupid

539
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
he's foolish

540
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,860
he's idiotic

541
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,280
and God says

542
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,140
when you refuse

543
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,860
to repent

544
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,480
and you turn

545
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,040
to the world

546
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,660
and you refuse

547
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,460
to turn away

548
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,240
you're just as stupid

549
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
and just as nonsensical

550
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,260
and just as idiotic

551
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,180
as the man

552
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,100
that just lies

553
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,400
there

554
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,320
and doesn't move

555
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,380
but you and I

556
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,820
say

557
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,160
but

558
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
I don't know

559
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,360
there's more fun

560
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,180
lying down there

561
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't believe

562
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,160
there is

563
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
and when God

564
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,780
says

565
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,040
this is the height

566
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,980
of stupidity

567
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,080
this morning

568
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,800
we ought to say

569
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,560
to ourselves

570
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,140
am I one

571
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,700
that has

572
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,560
wandered away

573
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,840
from Jesus Christ

574
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,360
and turned

575
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,980
to the world

576
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,020
and do I

577
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,440
refuse

578
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,900
to return

579
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,680
am I

580
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,160
in the height

581
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,540
of folly

582
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,760
and foolishness

583
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,880
am I that stupid

584
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,940
before we answer

585
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,160
let's know this

586
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
it's easy

587
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
to be stupid

588
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
and the reason

589
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
why it's easy

590
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,860
is that you and I

591
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,880
think we're logical

592
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,980
thinking

593
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,620
reasoning

594
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,500
human beings

595
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,660
and that we decide

596
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,640
our moral conduct

597
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,560
on the basis

598
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,180
of logic

599
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,880
let me prove

600
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,000
how wrong we are

601
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,820
the best investigation

602
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,760
and I'm not here

603
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,500
to talk about

604
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,800
cigarettes as being wrong

605
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,580
there's nothing

606
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,340
in the word of God

607
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,280
that says it's wrong

608
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,060
but I know

609
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,880
and you know

610
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,180
that men who have

611
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,600
gone into research

612
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
about cigarettes

613
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,120
and lungs

614
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,680
tell us

615
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,820
that the cigarette

616
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,920
smoker has a greater

617
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,280
incidence to lung cancer

618
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
it brings on

619
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,620
again emphysema

620
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,880
that there's no doubt

621
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,320
about it

622
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,040
there is a direct

623
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,440
connection

624
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,680
now that's what

625
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,900
medicine said

626
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,240
you would think

627
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
then if you and I

628
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
ran our life

629
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,860
on the basis

630
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,800
of our head

631
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,180
and not on emotion

632
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,220
that there would be

633
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,200
such a drop

634
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
in smoking cigarettes

635
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,820
that they'd almost

636
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,660
go out of business

637
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,740
and yet they're up

638
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,540
greater sales

639
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,080
in cigarettes

640
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,540
why

641
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,340
because

642
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,180
the greatest

643
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,020
scientist

644
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,980
who can put

645
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,780
astronauts

646
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,860
on the moon

647
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,060
who are so

648
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,000
scientific

649
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
can tell you

650
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,000
about a hole

651
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,700
in a cigarette

652
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,500
the point is

653
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,520
that you and I

654
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,600
don't decide

655
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,580
our moral way

656
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,040
of life

657
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
by the head

658
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
by logic

659
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,340
you and I

660
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,280
decided by

661
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,900
feeling

662
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,960
don't you ever

663
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,580
kid yourself

664
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,140
that you aren't

665
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,620
emotional

666
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,160
we smoke

667
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
because we like

668
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,480
it

669
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
we exempt

670
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,220
ourselves

671
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
the man that

672
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,660
turns to the world

673
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
he isn't logical

674
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,560
he is stupid

675
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:15,920
why

676
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,700
you can see it

677
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,180
with the guy

678
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,240
lying on the ground

679
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
when it comes home

680
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,420
to you and me

681
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,220
we are

682
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,300
like again

683
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,240
a little speck

684
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,860
of reason

685
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,060
in an ocean

686
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,800
of emotion

687
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,820
it's the heart

688
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,200
and the heart

689
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,560
again

690
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,660
you can't trust

691
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,020
it's feeling

692
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,920
and because of that

693
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
again

694
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,780
that's what God

695
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,060
says

696
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,880
we rush in

697
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,540
like a horse

698
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,780
unbridled into battle

699
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,920
and we ought to

700
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,400
realize

701
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
that the head

702
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,160
doesn't decide

703
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,920
in your case

704
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,280
and mine

705
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,500
nearly as much

706
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,360
as the heart

707
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,140
or the emotion

708
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,520
the way we feel

709
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,380
what do we care

710
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,260
about logic

711
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,200
or about reasoning

712
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,580
and thus again

713
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,620
we ought to realize

714
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,060
this

715
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,540
that you can't

716
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:54,940
predict

717
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,680
what you and I

718
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,320
will do

719
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,920
in these choices

720
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,840
when the world

721
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,580
beckons

722
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,680
God

723
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,940
says to Jeremiah

724
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,900
you tell the people

725
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,380
of Judah

726
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,720
that the stork

727
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,540
knows her season

728
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,160
talking about

729
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,120
migratory birds

730
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,980
you can predict

731
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,200
what a migratory bird

732
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,820
is going to do

733
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,220
when it comes

734
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,840
spring

735
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,220
the migratory bird

736
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,820
is going to go

737
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
one day way

738
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,040
and when it comes

739
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,540
fall

740
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,420
he's going to go

741
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,780
another

742
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,800
and that is

743
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,300
instinct

744
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,080
and he follows

745
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,900
that pattern

746
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,680
and you don't

747
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,400
stop him

748
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,420
but God

749
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:23,960
says

750
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,380
yes

751
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,120
they know

752
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,960
their seasons

753
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,040
but my people

754
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,800
do not know

755
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,480
the ordinances

756
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,120
of the Lord

757
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,100
you and I

758
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,540
are the most

759
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,320
unpredictable

760
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,980
beings

761
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,520
that God

762
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,140
has created

763
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,200
who knows

764
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,660
what you're

765
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,060
going to do

766
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,480
next

767
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,080
or I

768
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
in this matter

769
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,880
of moral

770
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
conduct

771
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,000
oh it's

772
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,340
simply

773
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,060
unpredictable

774
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,840
women were

775
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,580
at a bridge

776
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:42,940
club

777
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,820
one afternoon

778
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,960
just to show

779
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,240
you what

780
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,600
happens

781
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,040
and so they

782
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,520
decided

783
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,940
each one

784
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,220
would take

785
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,600
a paper

786
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,080
and pencil

787
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,840
and they

788
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,400
would decide

789
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,920
what would

790
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,340
you do

791
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,780
in this

792
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,180
case

793
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,860
you have

794
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,400
found out

795
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,780
that your

796
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,160
husband

797
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,800
has another

798
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,340
woman on

799
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,780
the string

800
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,260
now here's

801
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,660
the gun

802
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,440
you're going

803
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,920
to shoot

804
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,520
somebody

805
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,120
whom would

806
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,640
you shoot

807
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,160
rather strange

808
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,180
the answers

809
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,540
came

810
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,060
one woman

811
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,640
said she'd

812
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:02,900
shoot her

813
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,160
husband

814
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,540
and kill

815
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:03,860
him

816
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,680
another one

817
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,200
said she'd

818
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,520
kill the

819
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,060
other woman

820
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,920
another one

821
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,380
said no

822
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,880
she'd kill

823
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,380
herself

824
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,460
another one

825
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,000
said she'd

826
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,300
kill her

827
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,620
husband

828
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,200
and the

829
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,760
other woman

830
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,440
and then

831
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,220
kill herself

832
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,240
another one

833
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,960
said again

834
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,620
that she

835
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,220
would kill

836
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,720
those

837
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,520
and commit

838
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,000
suicide

839
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,900
for herself

840
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,820
or again

841
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,380
she would

842
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:20,900
just kill

843
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,280
the other

844
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,640
woman

845
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,380
there was

846
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,040
no rhyme

847
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,540
or reason

848
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,900
to the

849
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,280
answers

850
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,660
why

851
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
it's

852
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,020
thoroughly

853
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,760
unpredictable

854
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,280
that's why

855
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,760
one of you

856
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,260
said to me

857
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,600
you like

858
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,160
to be around

859
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,660
animals

860
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,120
more than

861
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,420
around

862
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,100
human beings

863
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
because you

864
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,400
can predict

865
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,780
what an

866
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,360
animal is

867
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,640
going to

868
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:33,740
do

869
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,080
I can

870
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,420
tell what

871
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,900
my dog

872
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,160
is going

873
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,500
to do

874
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,060
under

875
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,420
certain

876
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,100
circumstances

877
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,840
but you

878
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,180
and I

879
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,820
don't know

880
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,320
what we're

881
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,760
going to

882
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,000
do

883
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,560
because

884
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,400
the head

885
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,340
doesn't run

886
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,300
your life

887
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,380
or mine

888
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,720
nearly

889
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,260
like the

890
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,600
heart

891
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,420
how do

892
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,920
you feel

893
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,720
God

894
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,440
says it's

895
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,920
the height

896
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,100
of stupidity

897
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,160
is it

898
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,200
God says

899
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,520
when you

900
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:52,840
and I

901
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,320
turn away

902
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,940
from him

903
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,980
it's the

904
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,260
height

905
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,800
of stupidity

906
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:55,900
and you

907
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,160
and I

908
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,680
say well

909
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,260
I can

910
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,740
see when

911
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,140
this guy

912
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,520
is lying

913
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:58,920
down there

914
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,300
he's sure

915
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,680
a stupid

916
00:19:59,680 --> 00:19:59,920
fool

917
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,280
not to

918
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,620
get up

919
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,180
but when

920
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,420
you hook

921
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,680
it up

922
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,580
it's pretty

923
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,120
nice down

924
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,420
there

925
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,040
I see

926
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,280
a lot

927
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,880
more fun

928
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,300
in serving

929
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,700
the world

930
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:05,980
a lot

931
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,900
more fun

932
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,780
in going

933
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,220
out for

934
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,600
worldly

935
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,120
pleasures

936
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,500
but

937
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,440
God

938
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,960
says

939
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,320
there's

940
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,160
more fun

941
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,100
and God

942
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,840
is convinced

943
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,300
of it

944
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,880
in following

945
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,360
Christ

946
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,720
and in

947
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:15,960
following

948
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,360
the world

949
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,520
do you

950
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,860
believe it

951
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,260
I think

952
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,480
in the

953
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,980
second place

954
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,240
God

955
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,860
reminds you

956
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,160
and me

957
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,680
that whenever

958
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,280
we follow

959
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,920
the world

960
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,540
we bring

961
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,120
sorrow

962
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,920
and we

963
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,320
bring

964
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,000
heartache

965
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,560
on others

966
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
I don't

967
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:27,900
I don't think

968
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,160
I ever

969
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,540
have a

970
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,820
funeral

971
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,220
when I

972
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,380
have

973
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,620
buried

974
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,080
somebody

975
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,260
who

976
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,400
has

977
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,620
thrown

978
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:30,780
his

979
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,040
life

980
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,420
away

981
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
that

982
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,820
somebody

983
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,140
from the

984
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,420
family

985
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,840
will come

986
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,300
up and say

987
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,580
it's too

988
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,200
bad about

989
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,940
so and so

990
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,020
rather sad

991
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,780
but he only

992
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,700
hurt himself

993
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,820
he only hurt

994
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,200
himself

995
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,240
there is no

996
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,020
bigger lie in all

997
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,460
the world

998
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,920
do you think

999
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,300
you and I

somebody else

1014
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,300
since when

1016
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,260
society

1018
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,280
life

1019
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,680
when we

1020
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,140
are so

1021
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,820
inseparably

1022
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,240
connected

1023
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,580
with one

1024
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:56,820
another

1025
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,520
it is

1026
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,140
impossible

1027
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,900
for any

1028
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,260
man

1029
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,580

1030
00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,800
to the

1031
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,160
world

1032
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,000
and to

1033
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,340
live to

1034
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,720
the world

1035
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,100
without

1036
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,600
hurting

1037
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,500
deeply

1038
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,100
somebody

1039
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,360
they

1040
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,000
love

1041
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,260
when the

1042
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,900
family is

1043
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,440
broken up

1044
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,960
talk to

1045
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,660
the kids

1046
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,020
who come

1047
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,640
from broken

1048
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,380
homes

1049
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,680
something's

1050
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,100
wrong

1051
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,420
they're

1052
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,900
marked

1053
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,480
children

1054
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:14,980
for the

1055
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,440
rest of

1056
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,920
their lives

1057
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,300
why

1058
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,140
God

1059
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,460
never

1060
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,200
intended

1061
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,820
children

1062
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,680
to be

1063
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,260
raised in

1064
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,720
a broken

1065
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,280
home

1066
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,160
but when

1067
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,700
we turn

1068
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,080
to the

1069
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,420
world

1070
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,780
and the

1071
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,000
world

1072
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,560
breaks up

1073
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,760
our

1074
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,060
home

1075
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,260
what

1076
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,800
happens

1077
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,540
and then

1078
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,160
how about

1079
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,360
the

1080
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,920
illegitimate

1081
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,460
children

1082
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,720
oh when

1083
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,400
an illegitimate

1084
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
child comes

1085
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,660
yes

1086
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,980
the mother

1087
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,580
who isn't

1088
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:33,900
married

1089
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,500
can say

1090
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,000
I love

1091
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,560
my child

1092
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,900
enough

1093
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,280
that I'm

1094
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,600
going to

1095
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,220
put my

1096
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,740
child out

1097
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,360
for adoption

1098
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm going

1099
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,540
to see

1100
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,880
that my

1101
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,380
child gets

1102
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,820
a name

1103
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,460
I'm going

1104
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,760
to see

1105
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,120
that my

1106
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,700
child gets

1107
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,100
a home

1108
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,340
and a

1109
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,720
father and

1110
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,040
mother who

1111
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,380
will love

1112
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,940
my child

1113
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,480
who will

1114
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,840
give my

1115
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,320
child an

1116
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,760
opportunity

1117
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,420
that is

1118
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,800
good

1119
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,380
and I

1120
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,240
compliment you

1121
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,860
for that

1122
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,580
but is that

1123
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,020
the end of

1124
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,680
the story

1125
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,240
is that

1126
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,720
the end of

1127
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,240
the story

1128
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,740
I have

1129
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,520
placed any

1130
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,260
number of

1131
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,840
adopted

1132
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,660
children in

1133
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,080
homes

1134
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,960
and may I

1135
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,700
testify to

1136
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,200
you parents

1137
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,820
with adopted

1138
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,260
children

1139
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,180
the love

1140
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,060
and the joy

1141
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,500
that you

1142
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:03,960
have

1143
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
and again

1144
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,320
the care

1145
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,740
that you

1146
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,120
share

1147
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,060
sometimes is

1148
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,540
greater than

1149
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:07,960
you'd ever

1150
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,560
show on

1151
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,260
your own

1152
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,240
but what's

1153
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,560
the other

1154
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,100
side of

1155
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,620
the story

1156
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,980
when the

1157
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,400
adopted

1158
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,260
child comes

1159
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,620
in to

1160
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,180
see me

1161
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,540
as a

1162
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,080
young lady

1163
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,600
did not

1164
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,380
long ago

1165
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,560
and says

1166
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,220
did my

1167
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,540
mother really

1168
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,680
love me

1169
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,440
so much

1170
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,880
that she

1171
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,440
gave me

1172
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,860
away

1173
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,900
was I

1174
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,680
a child

1175
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,360
of love

1176
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,900
or was it

1177
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,560
just plain

1178
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,020
lust

1179
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,860
was it

1180
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,380
just this

1181
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,720
that my

1182
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,140
mother was

1183
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,500
out on

1184
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,980
a fling

1185
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,660
and she

1186
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,280
got tight

1187
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,760
was that

1188
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,120
all it

1189
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,700
was

1190
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,900
am I

1191
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,440
nothing

1192
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,140
who was

1193
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,760
my mother

1194
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,280
what kind

1195
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,760
of a woman

1196
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,240
was she

1197
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,660
what was

1198
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,240
my father

1199
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,760
like

1200
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,120
was my

1201
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,600
mother a

1202
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,020
tramp

1203
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,540
I'd like

1204
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,960
to know

1205
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,640
what she's

1206
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,000
like

1207
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,380
if she

1208
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:46,780
was a

1209
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,140
tramp

1210
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,600
then I'm

1211
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,180
a tramp

1212
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,220
then no

1213
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,180
one cares

1214
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I'll throw

1215
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,740
my life

1216
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,180
away

1217
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,640
and I don't

1218
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,080
care how

1219
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,700
I live

1220
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,220
and I don't

1221
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,600
care

1222
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,780
what I

1223
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,120
do

1224
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,860
don't you

1225
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,280
and I

1226
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,940
ever kid

1227
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,620
ourselves

1228
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,020
that when

1229
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,460
we turn

1230
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,960
away from

1231
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,880
Jesus Christ

1232
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,400
and turn

1233
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,980
to the world

1234
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,520
we hurt

1235
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,200
only ourselves

1236
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,920
that's a

1237
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,480
lie

1238
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,940
that's

1239
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,400
the lie

1240
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
the age

1241
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,520
more fun

1242
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,940
in Jesus

1243
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,480
Christ

1244
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,980
the fun

1245
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,260
what

1246
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,780
of right

1247
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,200
living

1248
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,380
you may

1249
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,920
say what

1250
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,680
fun is

1251
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,240
there in

1252
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,540
right

1253
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:16,960
living

1254
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
and may

1255
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,380
I just

1256
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,220
say this

1257
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,280
the word

1258
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,860
of God

1259
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,620
says

1260
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,300
that right

1261
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,140
living is

1262
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,780
joyful

1263
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,240
living

1264
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,020
the beauty

1265
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,920
of holiness

1266
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,980
I wonder

1267
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,320
if you

1268
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,700
and I

1269
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,540
don't forget

1270
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,960
this

1271
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,360
and maybe

1272
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:30,820
that's

1273
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,260
the fault

1274
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,520
of the

1275
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,800
pulpit

1276
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,580
that when

1277
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,960
we think

1278
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,400
of Jesus

1279
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,800
and his

1280
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,160
sufferings

1281
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,420
on the

1282
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,620
cross

1283
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,120
we forget

1284
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,700
that his

1285
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,100
was the

1286
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,500
happiest

1287
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:36,940
life

1288
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,280
that was

1289
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,780
ever lived

1290
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,360
don't forget

1291
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,680
that

1292
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,840
the grandest

1293
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
the happiest

1294
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,340
the most

1295
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,840
joyous

1296
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,480
the most

1297
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,400
effervescing

1298
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,860
life

1299
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,360
that was

1300
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,080
ever lived

1301
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,560
was that

1302
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,980
of Jesus

1303
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,700
of Nazareth

1304
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,600
in spite

1305
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,220
of the cross

1306
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,540
why

1307
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,080
because it

1308
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,320
was a

1309
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,960
holy life

1310
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,300
John Milton

1311
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,660
says

1312
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,360
virtue has

1313
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,820
its own

1314
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,220
reward

1315
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,580
in other

1316
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:53,800
words

1317
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,220
he says

1318
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,980
the joy

1319
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,400
of right

1320
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,700
living

1321
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,140
is right

1322
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,480
living

1323
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,980
and only

1324
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,520
those who

1325
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,180
live right

1326
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,020
experience

1327
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,700
the joy

1328
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,780
the joy

1329
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,420
of peace

1330
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,060
in Jesus

1331
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,740
Christ

1332
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,880
if Christ

1333
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,540
was the

1334
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:05,960
happiest

1335
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,520
life

1336
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,840
then there

1337
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,360
is more

1338
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,920
happiness

1339
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,620
in following

1340
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,100
Jesus

1341
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,660
Christ

1342
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,420
than in

1343
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,100
any fun

1344
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,480
that the

1345
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,940
world may

1346
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,220
offer

1347
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,780
that is only

1348
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,220
temporary

1349
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,780
you know

1350
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,420
sometimes we

1351
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,820
may say to

1352
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:15,980
ourselves

1353
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,620
why is it

1354
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,300
wrong right

1355
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,040
why didn't

1356
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,600
God make

1357
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,240
wrong right

1358
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,640
so we can

1359
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,080
go out

1360
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,880
and live to

1361
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,280
the world

1362
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,880
and drink

1363
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,660
in immorality

1364
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,220
and drink

1365
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,980
in drunkenness

1366
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,460
and go out

1367
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,820
and take

1368
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,300
the trip

1369
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,460
and go out

1370
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,280
like a horse

1371
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,900
that rides

1372
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,600
unbridled

1373
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,180
in the battle

1374
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,080
why can't

1375
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,720
we do that

1376
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,160
why didn't

1377
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,740
he do it

1378
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,200
didn't God

1379
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,560
want us to

1380
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:34,880
have a good

1381
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,500
time

1382
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,220
I think the

1383
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,620
first thing

1384
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,140
we've got to

1385
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,140
say is this

1386
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,720
God is holy

1387
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,320
and God

1388
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,620
says that's

1389
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,400
the happiest

1390
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,040
life

1391
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,360
but we forget

1392
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,080
something about

1393
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,980
sin we forget

1394
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,060
that sin is not

1395
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,240
only an offense

1396
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,900
against God

1397
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,600
but it's got a

1398
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,140
sinfulness

1399
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,080
connected with it

1400
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,340
we forget the

1401
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,880
sinfulness of sin

1402
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,220
that sin brings

1403
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,780
the result

1404
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,340
that whenever

1405
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,700
wrong is done

1406
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,820
it isn't only

1407
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,600
a wrong done

1408
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,420
but it has

1409
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,440
results

1410
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,240
and it brings

1411
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,740
sorrow

1412
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,280
and it brings

1413
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,060
heartache

1414
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,100
and it makes

1415
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
people say

1416
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,260
why was I

1417
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,900
ever born

1418
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,120
when innocent

1419
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
people suffer

1420
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,520
when we live

1421
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,240
for the world

1422
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,320
and when you

1423
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,060
and I believe

1424
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,840
that God says

1425
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,240
listen

1426
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,780
the man that

1427
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,280
turns away

1428
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,760
from Jesus

1429
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,540
Christ and

1430
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,300
lives to the

1431
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,060
world because

1432
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,620
there's more

1433
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,260
fun

1434
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,640
is stupid

1435
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,500
just as foolish

1436
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,300
and stupid

1437
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,140
and insane

1438
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,800
he's lost

1439
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,300
what little

1440
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,920
he's got

1441
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,480
just as stupid

1442
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,060
as the man

1443
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,620
that falls

1444
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,180
down and

1445
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,840
doesn't have

1446
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,340
sense enough

1447
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,820
to get up

1448
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,380
when he falls

1449
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:36,820
down

1450
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,720
or the man

1451
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,100
that's on

1452
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,520
the wrong

1453
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,860
road that

1454
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,200
doesn't have

1455
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,680
sense enough

1456
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,000
to get to

1457
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,380
the right

1458
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,860
road

1459
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,460
God Almighty

1460
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,240
assures you

1461
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,620
and me

1462
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:43,640
and me

1463
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,160
again

1464
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,740
that there's

1465
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,540
more fun

1466
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,180
in following

1467
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,640
Christ

1468
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,040
and we say

1469
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,380
is there

1470
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,920
because in

1471
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,300
the third

1472
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,640
place

1473
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,160
let's know

1474
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,600
this

1475
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
that God

1476
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,400
reminds you

1477
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,960
and me

1478
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,520
that when

1479
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,100
we live

1480
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,400
for the

1481
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,840
world

1482
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,000
there comes

1483
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,440
a dread

1484
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,020
of God

1485
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,340
and the

1486
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,780
judgment

1487
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,060
don't kid

1488
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,660
yourself

1489
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,280
the man

1490
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,700
that has

1491
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,540
sown his

1492
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,160
life to

1493
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,680
the world

1494
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,620
who has

1495
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,180
turned his

1496
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,720
back on

1497
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,620
Jesus Christ

1498
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,180
and God

1499
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,780
calls and

1500
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,520
refuses to

1501
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,040
go back

1502
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
when again

1503
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,320
the years

1504
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,060
come and the

1505
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
years roll

1506
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,520
and he sees

1507
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,120
the regret

1508
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,580
that has

1509
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,020
come

1510
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,760
and the

1511
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,360
sorrow that

1512
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,940
his life

1513
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,380
has brought

1514
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,100
to himself

1515
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,460
and to

1516
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,960
others that

1517
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,560
he's loved

1518
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,760
he's afraid

1519
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,540
to die

1520
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,760
that's why

1521
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,620
oh sometimes

1522
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:22,920
there's a

1523
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,520
braggadocia

1524
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,020
that's the

1525
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,480
guy that

1526
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,860
says

1527
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
oh when

1528
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,620
I die

1529
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,200
bury me

1530
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,460
in a

1531
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,780
Jewish

1532
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,320
cemetery

1533
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,740
it's the

1534
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,300
last place

1535
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,700
God will

1536
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,060
look for

1537
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,340
me

1538
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,220
ha ha ha

1539
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,620
that's

1540
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,880
supposed to

1541
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,280
be funny

1542
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,740
you know

1543
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,300
yeah God

1544
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,840
will find

1545
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,180
or the

1546
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,600
fellow says

1547
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:35,900
I want

1548
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,360
my body

1549
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,040
cremated

1550
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,060
there may

1551
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,480
be a lot

1552
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
of legitimate

1553
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,620
reasons for

1554
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,100
cremation

1555
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,680
but many a

1556
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,340
man wants

1557
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,840
it burned

1558
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,300
up to

1559
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,760
dust

1560
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,160
hoping that

1561
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,780
God won't

1562
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,160
have the

1563
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,640
power to

1564
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:45,940
put it

1565
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,580
back together

1566
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:46,920
again

1567
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
how stupid

1568
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,140
can we

1569
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,500
get

1570
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,840
to be

1571
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,240
afraid

1572
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,740
and to

1573
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,060
dread

1574
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,320
the

1575
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,780
judgment

1576
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,300
day

1577
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,680
and in

1578
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,100
contrast

1579
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,760
to that

1580
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,280
following

1581
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,760
Christ

1582
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,540
to have

1583
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:55,920
him as

1584
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,120
our

1585
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,040
companionship

1586
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,700
and then

1587
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,020
to know

1588
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,380
that there

1589
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,740
is an

1590
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,300
eternity

1591
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,480
in the

1592
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,840
fullness

1593
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,560
of joy

1594
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,200
in heaven

1595
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,680
awaiting

1596
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,160
us

1597
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,120
people say

1598
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,580
what will

1599
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,060
heaven be

1600
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,340
like

1601
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,600
heaven

1602
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,020
will be

1603
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,400
holiness

1604
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,900
and some

1605
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,340
say oh

1606
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,760
shoot

1607
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,260
who wants

1608
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,540
to go

1609
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:08,920
to heaven

1610
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,600
if it's

1611
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:09,900
going to

1612
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,480
be holiness

1613
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,800
but heaven

1614
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,500
is fullness

1615
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,200
of joy

1616
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,760
what that

1617
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,260
means I

1618
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,020
don't know

1619
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,940
except I

1620
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,400
know this

1621
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,880
what that

1622
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,560
joy is going

1623
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,060
to be like

1624
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,740
but in heaven

1625
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,540
with Christ

1626
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,680
who has gone

1627
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
to prepare a

1628
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,180
place for us

1629
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,260
it means joy

1630
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,000
to the very

1631
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,840
nth degree

1632
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,180
it means no

1633
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,060
craving for

1634
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,880
anything but

1635
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,460
what it will be

1636
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,040
satisfied

1637
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
it will be

1638
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,660
the absolute

1639
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,380
joy

1640
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,520
it must be

1641
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,240
wonderful

1642
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
although God

1643
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,560
can't even

1644
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,400
describe it in

1645
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,000
human language

1646
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,880
because my

1647
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,440
Lord came

1648
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,740
into the

1649
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,160
world and

1650
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,600
died on

1651
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,120
the cross

1652
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,020
so that I

1653
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,520
might have

1654
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,040
that fullness

1655
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,640
of joy

1656
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,660
he rose from

1657
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,180
the dead to

1658
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,680
assure me

1659
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,020
that he had

1660
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,380
bought it

1661
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,760
for me

1662
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,320
and he

1663
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,840
gloriously

1664
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,580
returned to

1665
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,000
heaven and

1666
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,520
he prepares

1667
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,180
a place for

1668
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,540
you and

1669
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:49,960
for me

1670
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,840
and for all

1671
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,280
who love

1672
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,620
him it

1673
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,300
must be

1674
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,960
tremendous

1675
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,160
and oh

1676
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,640
to God

1677
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:54,980
that you

1678
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,360
and I

1679
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,000
would just

1680
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,760
not be

1681
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,680
so stupid

1682
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,540
as again

1683
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,280
to say that

1684
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,060
it can't be

1685
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,780
joy and to

1686
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,100
miss it

1687
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,780
I don't want

1688
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,580
to miss it

1689
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,940
fullness of

1690
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,720
joy to me

1691
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,420
that's worth

1692
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,500
waiting for

1693
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,860
which simply

1694
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,640
means this

1695
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,200
bringing it

1696
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,780
right down

1697
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,440
in your pew

1698
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,100
and right up

1699
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,540
here into

1700
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,000
you who are

1701
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,380
listening

1702
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,860
when God

1703
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,560
says if we

1704
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,080
have turned

1705
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,780
away and we

1706
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,500
refuse to

1707
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,200
repent we

1708
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,880
are as stupid

1709
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,500
as a man

1710
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,020
that falls

1711
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,580
down who

1712
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,060
isn't hurt

1713
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,520
and refuses

1714
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,200
to get up

1715
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,620
God says

1716
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,100
again why

1717
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,500
don't you

1718
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,200
repent and

1719
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,560
why don't

1720
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:26,880
you come

1721
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,340
back

1722
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,540
perhaps some

1723
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,000
of us would

1724
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,640
say I'd

1725
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,100
like to go

1726
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,520
back to

1727
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,460
Jesus Christ

1728
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,820
I'd like to

1729
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,580
repent and

1730
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,400
return to him

1731
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,720
I've had

1732
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,120
enough of

1733
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,460
this

1734
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,540
I found

1735
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,040
out that

1736
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,660
it isn't

1737
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,400
all is not

1738
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,040
gold that

1739
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,380
glitters

1740
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,820
and we may

1741
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,220
say but what

1742
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,640
kind of a

1743
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,320
reception do

1744
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,860
you get from

1745
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,200
heaven

1746
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,340
we may say

1747
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,660
to ourselves

1748
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,200
yeah I'll go

1749
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,800
back and God

1750
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,180
says what

1751
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,140
time what

1752
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,640
time you're

1753
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,240
coming back

1754
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,780
I thought you

1755
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,380
would I

1756
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,800
thought you'd

1757
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,460
go out and

1758
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,340
live your life

1759
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,720
the way you

1760
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,080
want to live

1761
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,420
and then you

1762
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,000
come back

1763
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,620
and then you

1764
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,360
expect me to

1765
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,100
take you back

1766
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,780
and you and

1767
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,640
I may say

1768
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,320
I don't want

1769
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,340
that kind of

1770
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,180
a reception

1771
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
don't you know

1772
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,400
what kind of a

1773
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,180
reception you and

1774
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,940
I get when we

1775
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,620
come back

1776
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,660
Jesus told a

1777
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,360
story once

1778
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,860
there's no

1779
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,480
secret

1780
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,920
as to the

1781
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,740
kind of reception

1782
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,640
Jesus told a

1783
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,260
story about a

1784
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,960
younger man you

1785
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,360
know that went

1786
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,140
away from home

1787
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,980
and he went

1788
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,600
out and boy he

1789
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,260
lived it up there

1790
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,840
wasn't anything

1791
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,600
that he hadn't

1792
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,020
done

1793
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,360
just like the

1794
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,800
mother that

1795
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,360
came in and

1796
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,900
told me about

1797
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,780
her 14 year old

1798
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,400
girl she said

1799
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,700
Reverend

1800
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,580
Hansen my

1801
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,360
daughter's 14

1802
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,120
years old and

1803
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,400
there isn't

1804
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,880
anything she

1805
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,500
hasn't done

1806
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,740
she's run the

1807
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,580
gamut of sin

1808
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,140
from one end

1809
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,500
to the other

1810
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,340
you can't name

1811
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,160
it imagine

1812
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,980
14 years

1813
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,260
old 14

1814
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,820
years old

1815
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,280
everything that

1816
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,880
was wrong

1817
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,200
this young

1818
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,060
son of this

1819
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,600
father went

1820
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,020
out and did

1821
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,560
the same

1822
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
and then finally

1823
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,280
he got to the

1824
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,700
end of his

1825
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,240
robe didn't

1826
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,120
he and

1827
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
everything was

1828
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,640
gone and

1829
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
this longing

1830
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,940
and this

1831
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,900
yearning there

1832
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,420
was no more

1833
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,180
fun in anything

1834
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,860
and he decided

1835
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,560
to go home

1836
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,580
and he wondered

1837
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,320
too what kind

1838
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,800
of reception

1839
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,380
will I get

1840
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,700
will my

1841
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,180
father say

1842
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,520
why don't you

1843
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:52,800
stay home

1844
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,080
like your

1845
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,560
older brother

1846
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,200
then you'd

1847
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,700
amounted to

1848
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,000
something

1849
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,420
now you're

1850
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,980
coming back

1851
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,620
you've spent

1852
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,160
everything that

1853
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,640
I gave

1854
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,880
you

1855
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
why don't

1856
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,240
you

1857
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,080
he says

1858
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,020
I'm going

1859
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,300
home

1860
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,580
I don't

1861
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,840
know what

1862
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,140
I'm going

1863
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,500
to get

1864
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,100
I'll not

1865
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,680
plead that

1866
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,080
I want to

1867
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,620
be a son

1868
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,200
again if

1869
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,540
you just

1870
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,060
let me be

1871
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,560
a servant

1872
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,080
but he

1873
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
didn't know

1874
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,660
but he

1875
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,360
started back

1876
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,880
remember

1877
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,060
and oh

1878
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,680
God when he

1879
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,480
started back

1880
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,340
remember that

1881
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,860
there was a

1882
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,740
father waiting

1883
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,140
the father

1884
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,820
saw him

1885
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,360
before he

1886
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,800
ever saw

1887
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,300
the father

1888
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,960
there was a

1889
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,880
father out

1890
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,260
looking

1891
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,480
and he saw

1892
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,040
some in the

1893
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,360
distance

1894
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,540
and the

1895
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,100
father said

1896
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,220
I believe

1897
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,760
that's my

1898
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,180
boy

1899
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,700
I think

1900
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,200
it is

1901
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,960
it looks

1902
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,380
like

1903
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,860
oh he's

1904
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,200
dirty

1905
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,060
and he's

1906
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,240
I believe

1907
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,800
that's

1908
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,820
my son

1909
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,800
and he

1910
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,300
went on

1911
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,160
it is

1912
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,680
and he ran

1913
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,160
and he

1914
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,020
threw his

1915
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,560
arms around

1916
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,220
that boy

1917
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,500
and he

1918
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:44,720
said

1919
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,620
oh my

1920
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,220
son that

1921
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,520
was

1922
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,160
lost

1923
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,960
is found

1924
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,440
my son

1925
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,860
that was

1926
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,340
dead

1927
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,940
is alive

1928
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,360
again

1929
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,660
you know

1930
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,240
that boy

1931
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,420
he wondered

1932
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:54,820
what kind

1933
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,080
of reception

1934
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,440
he never

1935
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,860
got it out

1936
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,100
of his

1937
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,360
mouth

1938
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,700
he never

1939
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:56,920
said

1940
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,300
father

1941
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,500
I'm not

1942
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,740
worthy

1943
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:58,980
to be

1944
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,500

1945
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,220

hired

1948
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,220
he never

1949
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,740
got that

1950
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,100
out

1951
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,980
father said

1952
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,420
come on

1953
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,700
we're going

1954
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:03,900
to give

1955
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,380
you a bath

1956
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,680
we're going

1957
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:04,900
to put

1958
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,220
on a

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,420
clean

1960
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,720
roll

1961
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:05,960
we're going

1962
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,120
to put

1963
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,360
a ring

1964
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,580
on your

1965
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,000
finger

1966
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,660
we're going

1967
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:07,940
to kill

1968
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,400
the fat

1969
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,140
at death

1970
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,600
that was

1971
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,500
the reception

1972
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,300

1973
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,620
to make

1974
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,480
heaven happy

1975
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,040
when you

1976
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,580
and I

1977
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,340
think we're

1978
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,680
at the end

1979
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,260
of the line

1980
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,040
we say

1981
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,740
this isn't

1982
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,240
fun

1983
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,340
this is

1984
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,880
hell

1985
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm going

1986
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,920
back to

1987
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,440
Jesus

1988
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,240
oh what

1992
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,400
ring

1993
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,460
there's no

1994
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,400

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,720
done for

2004
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,240

2008
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,980
wide open

2009
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,480
he'll

2010
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,840
pardon you

2015
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,720
if we

2016
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,100
have

2017
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,880
fallen

2018
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,200
shall we

2019
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,620
not

2020
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,800
rise

2021
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,480
again

2022
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,420
let's

2023
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,000
don't be

2024
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,620
stupid

2025
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,680
it's

2026
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,540
no secret

2027
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,460
what God

2028
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,140
will do

2029
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,060
amen
