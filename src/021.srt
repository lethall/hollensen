1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,960
Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,120
Let us hear the word of God as we find it written back in the Old Testament.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,040
In the book of Psalms, the 110th Psalm, beginning at the first verse.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:30,460
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,780
The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion, rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,260
Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,680
In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,220
The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,220
And now may the words of my mouth, and the meditations of our hearts, be acceptable in thy sight.

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,820
O Lord, our strength, and our Redeemer. Amen.

11
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:16,660
Good morning, dear friends in Christ Jesus, you who are here in God's house, and you also of our radio audience.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
It is good to have you in God's house this morning.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,580
It is fine, radio friends, to have you worshiping with us also.

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:36,340
I assume that all of you have fought and have won the battle of the change of time, and you are here in God's house today.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,680
If you glanced at your calendar for this week, you noticed that this coming Thursday, May the 4th,

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,460
is marked on your church calendar as Ascension Day.

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,660
It is the 40th day after Easter.

18
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,500
You may say to yourself, what does it mean, Ascension Day?

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Well, Jesus arose on Easter, as we know, and in this 40-day period, from Easter to Ascension,

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,920
he showed himself alive to his followers, convincing them beyond the shadow of a doubt that he who died was alive again.

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,100
And they went out and they gave their lives for him, because they knew that he was alive.

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,840
On Easter Sunday, you recall, he appeared to Mary Magdalene.

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,740
She saw him alive, then the other women.

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,560
And in the afternoon, the two disciples on the way to Emmaus saw him and spoke of them.

25
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,660
There was a private appearance to Peter that afternoon.

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,360
That night, Jesus appeared, Easter Sunday night, to the disciples when Thomas was not present.

27
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,200
The following Sunday night, you remember, he appeared when Thomas was present, that Thomas got to see him.

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,100
Then the disciples went up into Galilee, and there they had fished one night, and early one morning, Christ was on the shore.

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,740
Seven of them were fishing, and they came to the shore, as you recall,

30
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,520
ate breakfast with the living Christ when Peter was reinstated into the Apostolate.

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,160
Then there was another great appearance of Jesus on a mountaintop in Galilee,

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,500
and he had told them about that prior to his death, that they were to meet him there.

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,420
Paul mentions that about 500 gathered together at one place.

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Evidently, this was it, when about 500 followers plus the Apostles saw the living Christ

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,520
when he gave the great missionary command to go out and make disciples of all nations.

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,240
Then there was a private appearance to his brother James, of which we know nothing except the fact.

37
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:35,220
Then on the 40th day after Easter, on Ascension Day, Jesus made his last appearance to the 11th.

38
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,820
They walked up the slope of the Mount of Olives, past the Garden of Gethsemane,

39
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,140
and when they came to the top of the Mount of Olives, and Bethany was there right in the brief distance,

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,520
Jesus raised his hands and began to bless them, and as he did, something happened.

41
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,680
He started to go up, and the 11th stood there, and they looked up, and they gazed into heaven,

42
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,760
watching him as he was going up, and a cloud finally received him out of their sight.

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,740
And when that happened, there were two men standing by them in white apparel,

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,020
two angels that said, Ye men of Galilee, why are you standing, gazing into heaven?

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,260
That same Jesus that you have seen go into heaven is going to come in the same way someday.

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
He's going to return.

47
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And we may say to ourselves, well, what did it mean?

48
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,300
He went back to heaven.

49
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,140
The text that I read in the Old Testament, by inspiration of God, David wrote it,

50
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,220
and he said, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,500
David, who lived a thousand years before Christ, understood the ascension.

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,440
These words of the 110th Psalm apply to Jesus,

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,060
because Jesus in his earthly ministry applied them to himself.

54
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,920
David said a thousand years before ascension, The Lord said unto my Lord,

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:55,340
In other words, My God said unto my Lord, the Messiah, my Son, that would come from me.

56
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,260
God the Father said to God the Son, Sit thou at my right hand.

57
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
David saw it in prophecy.

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,160
Therefore on the ascension day, what a tremendous thing that must have been.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,720
Jesus had finished his work on earth.

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:16,700
He goes to heaven, and there 10,000 times 10,000 angels, 100 million angels,

61
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,460
and the saints of God, they greeted him.

62
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,660
And God the Father said, Son, sit at my right hand.

63
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,140
God the Father never became a human being.

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,400
He has no right hand.

65
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,760
Therefore, this is an expression that means the place of honor.

66
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,380
In other words, God the Father said to Jesus on ascension day,

67
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,280
Son, sit at my right hand.

68
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,380
Sit at the highest place of honor in heaven.

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,200
Occupy the greatest, highest place of glory.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,940
The grand place of distinction.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
Sit there, my son.

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,240
This is reserved for you.

73
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,480
What a tremendous homecoming.

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,200
And you and I may say, what does it all mean?

75
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,780
That he sits in the highest place of honor in heaven?

76
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,480
Why, it ought to be a source of comfort.

77
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,480
It ought to be a source of courage.

78
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,580
It ought to be a source of joy for you and me.

79
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,660
It ought to be a real spiritual shot in the arm, if there ever is anything that should give it to us.

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,040
We say, ascension, a spiritual shot in the arm.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,720
Jesus seated at the right hand of God.

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Seated in the highest place of honor.

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,240
But we may say to ourselves, but, oh, it's hard to feel that it's a spiritual shot for me.

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,200
That it's a source of courage for me in this world.

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,800
I feel that it's sort of a forsakenness.

86
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,480
That when he went to heaven, that he left me behind.

87
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,260
That he's forsaken me.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,380
I feel sort of abandoned in this world of sin.

89
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,000
Since he returned to heaven, and he is seated in the highest place of honor.

90
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,480
But Christian friends, ascension ought to be a spiritual shot in the arm for you and me.

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,920
The fact that our Christ sits at the right hand of God.

92
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,480
Because it wasn't an abandonment.

93
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
It wasn't a leaving you and me behind.

94
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,940
It wasn't a brush off.

95
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,240
He is seated in that highest place of honor.

96
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,640
And his greatest concern is you and me.

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,500
Do you realize that seated in that place of glory,

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,260
that Christ's greatest concern is you.

99
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,560
That he has the greatest concern for you as though you were the only one living on the face of the earth.

100
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,620
But he has an equal concern for me.

101
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,640
And for all of his children.

102
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,680
As though we were the only ones that he had to be concerned about.

103
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,420
That's the spiritual shot in the arm.

104
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,700
Because seated at the right hand of majesty,

105
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,000
he has you and me in his heart.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,340
Oh, what a thrilling thing it ought to be to know that our Christ has as his chief concern,

107
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,020
his chief interest, his chief care.

108
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,540
You and me.

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,280
We may say to ourselves, does he?

110
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,280
Why, in the first place, let's know this.

111
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,840
Christ, the God-man, he's seated at the right hand of God as our king.

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,780
David saw it in prophecy and he said,

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,300
The Lord said unto my Lord,

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Sit thou at my right hand,

115
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,140
and shall I make thine enemies thy footstube.

116
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,020
The Lord shall send the rod of strength out of Zion.

117
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,180
Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

118
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Christ came into the world, didn't he, to be a king.

119
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,120
And it was to be a kingdom far different than any kingdom the world had ever known previously.

120
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,660
Recall, he said to Pontius Pilate,

121
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,840
My kingdom is not of this world.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,560
Don't think of my kingdom as a worldly kingdom, Pilate.

123
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,160
He said,

124
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,740
Else would my soldiers fight.

125
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
At one other time, he says,

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,160
The kingdom of God doesn't come with observation.

127
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,020
You can't say,

128
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,800
There it is,

129
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,000
or here it is.

130
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,460
He says,

131
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,840
The kingdom of God is within you.

132
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,940
And you and I say,

133
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,180
Well, if he came to be the king of a kingdom,

134
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,100
what kind of a kingdom is it?

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,540
Every Sunday in church,

136
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,300
when we say the Apostles' Creed,

137
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,080
we say,

138
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,180
I believe in the Holy Christian Church,

139
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,660
the communion of saints.

140
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,680
That's the kingdom.

141
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,140
In other words,

142
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,580
we say,

143
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,840
I believe that there exists in this world,

144
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,060
even though I can't see it with my naked eye,

145
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,460
the kingdom of God,

146
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,380
the Holy Christian Church,

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,100
the communion of saints.

148
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,600
What is this kingdom?

149
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,540
This kingdom is the kingdom that exists right now here on earth,

150
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,780
that is made up of every true believer in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

151
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,180
It makes no difference what your denominational handle may be.

152
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,780
Whether you are a Lutheran or a Roman Catholic or a Methodist or a Baptist or an Episcopalian,

153
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,480
if you have come to a living faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and your Savior,

154
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,780
you are a member of the kingdom of the saved.

155
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,440
That's the kingdom,

156
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,420
tremendous,

157
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,220
wonderful,

158
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,000
that your king and mine came to establish.

159
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
And when the kingdom was established,

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,680
the kingdom of the saved,

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,860
the kingdom of those who have come to faith in him,

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,460
he went to heaven,

163
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,180
seated at the right hand of God,

164
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,120
and he still serves as king.

165
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
In the power that is his,

166
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,840
he watches that there is no power on earth or under the earth,

167
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,500
no power of Satan,

168
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,040
no power of the fallen angels,

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,300
that can never be so great that it can destroy that kingdom.

170
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,520
That kingdom is an invincible and eternal kingdom.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,820
And therefore,

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
as he sits as our king,

173
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
when you and I pray to him,

174
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
he, the God-man,

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,320
guarantees you and me

176
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,780
that will never be kidnapped

177
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,740
from that kingdom.

178
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,900
Today is also Rogation Sunday,

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,720
or Rogate,

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,940
prayer Sunday.

181
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,220
And as you and I pray to him

182
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,700
who is seated in the throne of majesty on high,

183
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
there comes this guarantee,

184
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,300
because he is king.

185
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,020
No power shall ever

186
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,980
kidnap you and me

187
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,820
from the kingdom of God.

188
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,120
Even though you and I are unconscious,

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,360
even though you and I

190
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,780
are in the weakness of body,

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,420
may not be able to collect our thoughts,

192
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,420
Satan shall never,

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,480
never be able to have the power

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
to snatch you and me

195
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,480
from Jesus Christ,

196
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,240
to kidnap us against our will.

197
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,720
There will never come a time

198
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,080
when the powers of hell

199
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,900
can never rescue you and me

200
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,860
from Jesus Christ.

201
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,160
He sits and rules

202
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
in the midst of his enemies.

203
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,700
And as the Oriental potentate,

204
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,960
when he would conquer a king,

205
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,620
would have that king get down

206
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,160
and put his foot on his neck

207
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,900
or his head,

208
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,120
Jesus as king,

209
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,480
he rules in the midst

210
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
of his enemies.

211
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,920
And as David said,

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
the Lord said unto my Lord,

213
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,040
sit thou at my right hand

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,500
and tell them,

215
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,240
make thine enemies thy footstool.

216
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,180
The enemies of the kingdom of God

217
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,360
are the footstool of Jesus Christ,

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,160
given evidence from the fact

219
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,280
that the kingdom of God

220
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,540
still stands

221
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,640
and it will remain forever and ever.

222
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,160
You and I may say to ourselves,

223
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,940
what about those in Vietnam?

224
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,660
Will they ever torture my son?

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,520
And can he be kidnapped

226
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,020
from the kingdom of God?

227
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,360
Can again adversity

228
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,560
and troubles come

229
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,920
that will be so great

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,060
that they can pluck my child,

231
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,480
my son, my husband, my daughter

232
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,060
from the kingdom of God?

233
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,500
No!

234
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,020
That will never happen.

235
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,680
Oh, if you and I could only live

236
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,200
in the spirit of the ascension,

237
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,420
to know that it isn't abandonment,

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,560
it isn't this,

239
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,300
that he left us to ourselves,

240
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,140
he is seated at the right hand of God.

241
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,900
What a spiritual treat

242
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,860
and what a spiritual shot

243
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,160
in the arm it ought to be.

244
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,840
You are his chief concern,

245
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,980
as though you were the only one alive

246
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,260
on earth and so am I.

247
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,220
Each individual in his kingdom

248
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,060
is his chief concern

249
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,380
and if we lived in the light

250
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,040
of the ascension,

251
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,240
then we would pray with boldness

252
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,100
and with confidence

253
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,080
and with enthusiasm

254
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,780
and we would put tomorrow

255
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,840
into his hands.

256
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,320
We may shiver and be afraid

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,960
of tomorrow

258
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,200
and wonder what is coming,

259
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,900
but Paul knew this,

260
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,660
that because Christ rules as king,

261
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,500
he was able to say,

262
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,740
for I reckon and I know this

263
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,680
and I am convinced

264
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,320
that neither death nor life

265
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,540
nor angels nor principalities

266
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,380
nor powers

267
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,580
nor things present

268
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,720
nor things to come

269
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,140
nor height nor depth

270
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,320
nor any other creature

271
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,300
shall be able to separate us

272
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,360
from the love of God

273
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,420
which is in Christ Jesus.

274
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,300
And you and I can say it too.

275
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,520
Nothing will snatch you and me

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,060
from the kingdom of God

277
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,420
because seated at the right hand

278
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,660
of God is again

279
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,200
our Christ as king,

280
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,540
the God-man.

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,460
You know when he went to heaven

282
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,780
on Good Friday afternoon

283
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,280
in death,

284
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,540
his body stayed here.

285
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,040
But when he went to heaven

286
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,900
on the ascension,

287
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,520
he took his body with him

288
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,200
and I love to think of him

289
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
as a man on the throne

290
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,920
as well as God.

291
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,940
He says,

292
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,660
I know it's tough down there.

293
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,180
I spent 33 years on earth.

294
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,200
I know what adversity means.

295
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,940
I sat where you sat.

296
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,660
I know what troubles mean

297
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,080
and I know what powers

298
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
militate against you

299
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,360
and because he's a man,

300
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,560
he understands.

301
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
You and I have a man

302
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,160
on the throne,

303
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,740
seated in the grandest

304
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
and the most glorious place

305
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,360
in heaven.

306
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,300
You and I are the apple

307
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,920
of his eye.

308
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,780
He is seated there

309
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,380
and he has you and me

310
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,220
in his heart.

311
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh, to live in the light

312
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,260
of the ascension.

313
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,940
Jesus Christ again,

314
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,180
seated at the right hand

315
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,700
of God,

316
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,340
said David.

317
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,300
The Lord said unto my Lord,

318
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,200
sit thou at my right hand.

319
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Oh, the place of honor,

320
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,700
the place of distinction,

321
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,980
the highest place

322
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
of glory in heaven.

323
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,960
And again,

324
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,840
seated there,

325
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,700
you and I,

326
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,800
ought to find

327
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,820
a tremendous spiritual shot

328
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,460
in the arm

329
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,320
because you are

330
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,180
his greatest concern

331
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
and so am I.

332
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,540
Oh, that's true

333
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
because Christ,

334
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,460
the God-man,

335
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,660
is seated at the right hand

336
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,160
of God

337
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,140
also as our priest.

338
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,780
He came into the world

339
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,960
not only to be a king

340
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,520
but he came to be a priest too.

341
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,900
You and I may say

342
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,180
he came as a high priest.

343
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,660
He was a different kind

344
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,120
of a priest.

345
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,020
He was not from

346
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,900
the family of Aaron.

347
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,660
Aaron's family gave

348
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,320
the high priest

349
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,540
but Jesus was not

350
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,740
a descendant of Aaron.

351
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,500
Aaron was a Levite

352
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,360
and the Levite

353
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,300
furnished the priest.

354
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,340
Christ was from

355
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,440
the tribe of Judah

356
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,160
and Judah had no priest.

357
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,180
The priest didn't come

358
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,340
from the tribe of Judah.

359
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,960
He was to be different

360
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,420
but he came into the world

361
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,860
and he was a different priest.

362
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,260
Aaron and all

363
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,140
the Old Testament

364
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,100
high priests,

365
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,320
they offered

366
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
for the sins of the world

367
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,460
the blood of goats

368
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,620
and the blood of lambs.

369
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,640
They offered animals

370
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,780
but one great priest

371
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,720
came into the world,

372
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,660
our high priest,

373
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,740
and he offered

374
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,940
not the blood of goats

375
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,640
and of lambs

376
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,660
but his own blood.

377
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,840
John the Baptist

378
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,440
you recall

379
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,120
looked at him

380
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
and pointed one day

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
behold the Lamb of God.

382
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
Christ the Lamb of God

383
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,740
our high priest

384
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,040
became the sacrifice

385
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,940
and he as the Lamb of God

386
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,960
at Calvary

387
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,780
did something tremendous

388
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,580
for you and me

389
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,200
on earth.

390
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,620
It was by that

391
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,760
sufferings and death

392
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,180
that he met the justice

393
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,740
of his heavenly Father.

394
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,400
He took on himself

395
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,360
our guilt

396
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,220
and our punishment

397
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,280
and he bore

398
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,500
the equal of an eternity

399
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,060
in hell

400
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,960
for you and me.

401
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,180
He bore an exemption ticket

402
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,980
from hell

403
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,540
for you and for me.

404
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,280
Do you know

405
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,440
of any greater concern

406
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,800
than one that would do that?

407
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
And he scored

408
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,640
and earned

409
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,780
an admission ticket

410
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,340
to heaven

411
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,580
for you and me

412
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,680
and for all men.

413
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,840
He is the Lamb of God

414
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
who bore it

415
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
in his own flesh

416
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,040
upon the cross.

417
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,580
That's what he did

418
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,980
and now that he is in heaven

419
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,520
we are assured

420
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,420
that he sits

421
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,720
in the highest place

422
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,300
of honor

423
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
as our high priest

424
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,680
and David said

425
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
God has said

426
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,540
I have sworn

427
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,140
and I will not repent

428
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,500
thou art a priest

429
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,300
forever after

430
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,740
the order of Melchizedek

431
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,100
and you say

432
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,440
what did David mean by that?

433
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,560
A thousand years

434
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
before David lived

435
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,680
about two thousand years

436
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,400
before Christ

437
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,660
Abraham lived

438
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,300
and you remember

439
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,280
when Abraham left

440
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
the land of Ur

441
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,840
or the Chaldees

442
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
and he came over

443
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,860
into the land of Canaan.

444
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,460
In the land of Canaan

445
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,840
people had forgotten

446
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,780
anything about

447
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,500
the true God

448
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,860
it was heathenism

449
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,840
at its worst

450
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,140
but when he got

451
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,400
into the land of Canaan

452
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,260
one day

453
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,760
in the ancient city

454
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,640
of Jerusalem

455
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,960
the city of Salem

456
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,140
he met a man

457
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,500
by the name

458
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,600
of Melchizedek

459
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,140
and Melchizedek

460
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,120
was a priest

461
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,700
and king

462
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,020
of the most high God.

463
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
How Melchizedek

464
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,140
ever knew about God

465
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,240
and became a priest

466
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,820
and king

467
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,120
of the living God

468
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,900
nobody knows

469
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,300
there is no genealogy

470
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
given as regards

471
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,320
Melchizedek

472
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,000
we're not told

473
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,820
where he was born

474
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,340
or when

475
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,520
we are not told

476
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,460
about his death

477
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,820
and Melchizedek

478
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,420
becomes a symbol

479
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,400
of an eternal priesthood

480
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,380
and therefore again

481
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,880
just as he is a symbol

482
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,080
of an endless priesthood

483
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,160
your Christ and mine

484
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,700
seated at the right hand

485
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,360
of God

486
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,480
is an eternal priest

487
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,640
like Melchizedek

488
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,500
which in simple language

489
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,400
means this

490
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
his sacrifice

491
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
will never run out

492
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,060
the time will never come

493
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,160
that God will say

494
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,940
I'm sorry

495
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,420
I've got to throw

496
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,600
everybody out of heaven

497
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,220
because the sacrifice

498
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
of my son

499
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,940
ran out

500
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,860
with its efficacy

501
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,220
the time will never come

502
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,340
that God will say

503
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,740
no more sinners

504
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,080
can come into the kingdom

505
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,540
and come to life eternal

506
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,460
because the efficacy

507
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,400
of the Lamb of God

508
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,220
in his suffering

509
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,380
has run out

510
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,080
he is a priest forever

511
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,540
talk about a shot

512
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,040
in the arm

513
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,660
and that means

514
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,540
that when you and I

515
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,720
pray to this God man

516
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,780
as our high priest

517
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,040
he gladly

518
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,460
and willingly

519
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,880
and enthusiastically

520
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,680
forgives you and me

521
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
our sins every day

522
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,860
oh to go to this king

523
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,440
and to this high priest

524
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,740
who sits on the throne

525
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,780
and to go to him

526
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,240
every day

527
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,320
and confess our sins

528
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,760
of ignorance

529
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,360
he says

530
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,880
oh thank you for coming

531
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm glad to forgive you

532
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,620
when you and I

533
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,660
go to him every day

534
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,080
in prayer

535
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,300
and say my sins

536
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,780
of weakness

537
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,620
these are the things

538
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,520
I didn't want to do

539
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560
but I did them anyhow

540
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,400
they are gladly forgiven

541
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,100
and he says

542
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,360
thank you for coming

543
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm so glad to forgive you

544
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,260
and take your guilt

545
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,500
and your punishment away

546
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,020
it is all a privilege

547
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,680
he tells you

548
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,900
I'd rather forgive you

549
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,400
than eat

550
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
and if we come to him

551
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,180
with our sin again

552
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,900
of willfulness

553
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,260
where we have gone

554
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,960
against him

555
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
and we know better

556
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,220
and we are out of grace

557
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,860
and we go in

558
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,740
asking for forgiveness

559
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,480
he thanks us

560
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,020
for coming

561
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,460
and saying

562
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,200
thank you

563
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,080
I am glad to forgive you

564
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,480
and to reinstate you

565
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,760
and if you and I

566
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,480
have wandered away

567
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,860
from him for a long time

568
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,480
if we have persisted

569
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,500
in deliberate sin

570
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,060
if we have left him

571
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,260
and dethroned him

572
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,680
then we come back

573
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,100
we may say

574
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,220
what kind of a reception

575
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,100
do we get

576
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,740
why this king

577
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,960
that sits at the right hand

578
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,380
of God

579
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,800
is also our priest

580
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,620
and he says

581
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,420
I've been praying

582
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,940
for you

583
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,020
that you'd come back

584
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,400
I've been asking

585
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,080
the father

586
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,580
to keep giving you life

587
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,820
and not to take your life

588
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,040
and thank God

589
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,780
you're back

590
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,600
and gladly

591
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,420
and willingly

592
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,680
I forgive you

593
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,820
and I reinstate you

594
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,560
that's what ascension means

595
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,060
and if you and I

596
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,540
would say

597
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,480
today I'm going to live

598
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,900
in the light

599
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,660
of the ascension

600
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,860
I'm going to live

601
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,340
in the light

602
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,480
that the God man

603
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,380
there's a man

604
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,220
on the throne

605
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,440
and he is seated

606
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,160
in the place

607
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,080
of highest honor

608
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,740
and distinction

609
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,420
in heaven

610
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,720
and he has me

611
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,500
in his heart

612
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,000
I am his greatest

613
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,880
concern

614
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,060
and so is everyone

615
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,860
else

616
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,740
his greatest concern

617
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,940
if we lived in the light

618
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,100
of the ascension

619
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,680
then we would pray

620
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,660
with boldness

621
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,440
and confidence

622
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,460
and with enthusiasm

623
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,500
and we would go to him

624
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,120
again

625
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,960
if we're ashamed

626
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,700
of yesterday

627
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,480
how many of us

628
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,020
simply look back

629
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,620
at yesterday

630
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,120
again

631
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,020
at some sin

632
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,540
and we say to ourselves

633
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,720
I've gone to the throne

634
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,100
of grace

635
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,980
hundreds of times

636
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,620
and I've asked

637
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,200
for forgiveness

638
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
and then adversity comes

639
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,780
and then we plague

640
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,860
ourselves in addition

641
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,240
by saying

642
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,080
I'm being punished

643
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,580
I know I'm being punished

644
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,800
for something that I've done

645
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,080
not only do you have

646
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,560
the sickness

647
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,340
or the adversity

648
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,580
but that horrible

649
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,500
guilty conscience

650
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,160
where we condemn ourselves

651
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,600
and we say

652
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm being punished

653
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,840
but when we turn

654
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,820
to this great one

655
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,160
at the throne of grace

656
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
who is our high priest

657
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,960
and you and I say

658
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
forgive me this thing

659
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,600
that haunts my memory

660
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,300
when we have been there

661
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,000
before Jesus

662
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,860
says to you and me

663
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,260
you must be

664
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,080
what are you talking about

665
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know

666
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,160
what sin you're talking about

667
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,640
oh you brought that sin

668
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,540
to me long ago

669
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,160
and repented

670
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,540
and I drowned it

671
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,660
in the depths of the sea

672
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,460
don't you remember

673
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,080
I took it away from you

674
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,020
as far as the east

675
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,800
is from the west

676
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,960
I have blotted it out

677
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,060
off of your record

678
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't even remember it

679
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,080
you'll have to tell me

680
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,800
about it

681
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,440
I have blotted it eternally

682
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,340
from my mind

683
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,740
that's the kind of a Christ

684
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,160
then he says

685
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,120
if you think you're being

686
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,080
punished for sin

687
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,540
you're not

688
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,620
that's my love

689
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,140
how could I punish you

690
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,800
for a sin

691
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,580
that I have obliterated

692
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,480
from my mind eternally

693
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,020
because I remember

694
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,460
your sins no more

695
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,900
and when we can come

696
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,940
to the throne of grace

697
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,360
and have a Christ like that

698
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,420
then he says

699
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,460
don't you want the joy

700
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,020
of starting to forgive yourselves

701
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,960
or if we just start

702
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,200
to forgive ourselves

703
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,760
when he has long ago

704
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,620
forgiven us

705
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,260
and obliterated

706
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,920
even the memory of it

707
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,220
from his mind

708
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,020
oh what joy

709
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,660
there could be

710
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,300
and enthusiasm

711
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,100
in your life

712
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,480
and mine

713
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,820
if we lived in the light

714
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,740
of the ascension

715
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,260
our Christ

716
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,840
yes

717
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,940
he is seated

718
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,820
at the right hand

719
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,260
of God

720
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,460
David saw him

721
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,540
his Lord

722
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,400
and his son

723
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,960
and Jesus

724
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,500
quoted those words

725
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,580
he was talking about

726
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,280
the Messiah

727
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,380
and because

728
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,600
this Christ

729
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,020
is seated

730
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,740
at the right hand

731
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,160
of God

732
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,340
he is seated there

733
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,600
not only as our king

734
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,380
not only as our high priest

735
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,280
but also as our prophet

736
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,900
he came into the world

737
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,520
did he not

738
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
became flesh

739
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,900
to be a prophet

740
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,600
to be a teacher

741
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,940
and oh what a teacher

742
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,820
he was

743
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,240
he came into the world

744
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,380
not only to teach us

745
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,260
right and wrong

746
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,080
but you know

747
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
one day he said

748
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,380
to the world

749
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,180
I am the light

750
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,760
of the world

751
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,900
by that he meant this

752
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,620
did you ever realize

753
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:23,960
he meant

754
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,760
I am the one

755
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,520
that brings light

756
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,100
into the world

757
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,080
if I didn't come

758
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,200
the world would never

759
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,860
have light

760
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,040
the light of life

761
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,740
in other words

762
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,900
in me there is

763
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,700
eternal life

764
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,480
and without me

765
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,080
there isn't

766
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,420
everything is hopelessness

767
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,780
everything is lost

768
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,160
everything is darkness

769
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,260
forever and ever

770
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,540
that's what he taught

771
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,140
he taught men

772
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,840
that he was the light

773
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,320
of the world

774
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,020
then he went to heaven

775
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,760
and he is still

776
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,980
serving as our prophet

777
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,440
he went to heaven

778
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,220
and he moved men

779
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,960
to write down

780
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
what he had said

781
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,780
you have Matthew

782
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,820
Mark Luke and John

783
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,940
who have given us

784
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,800
the memoirs

785
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,720
of the life of Jesus

786
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,380
that you and I

787
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,100
know what he taught

788
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,220
he moved men

789
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,060
not only to write

790
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,660
the gospels

791
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,880
Matthew Mark Luke and John

792
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,000
but we have Acts

793
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,460
and Romans

794
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,700
and 1st and 2nd Corinthians

795
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,820
and Galatians

796
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,520
and Ephesians

797
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,180
and Philippians

798
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,880
and Colossians

799
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,660
and 1st and 2nd Thessalonians

800
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,800
and 1st and 2nd Timothy

801
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,780
and Titus

802
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,400
and Philemon

803
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,880
and Hebrews

804
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,520
and James

805
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,620
and 1st and 2nd Peter

806
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,300
and 1st and 2nd 3rd John

807
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,720
and Jude

808
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,400
and Revelation

809
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,800
that's the written word

810
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,040
and he is still protecting it

811
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,660
as a teacher

812
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,220
with the translations

813
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,100
that are coming out

814
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,120
you know it's tremendous

815
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,260
no age

816
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,640
has ever seen

817
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,500
the translations

818
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,460
of the word of God

819
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,520
that our age is seeing

820
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,640
men attempting

821
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,520
to make Christ

822
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,800
speak 20th century English

823
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,520
no longer can anybody

824
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,620
in the sound of my voice

825
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,060
this morning

826
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,600
never say

827
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,940
I don't read the scriptures

828
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,600
because I can't understand them

829
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,780
oh yes you can

830
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,500
if you can read and write

831
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,860
you can understand

832
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,060
some of the new translations

833
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,960
of the New Testament

834
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,500
they're right down your throat

835
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,720
he is the prophet

836
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,400
on the throne

837
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,540
and that prophet

838
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,440
assures you and me

839
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,580
that when we pray to him

840
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,160
for a stronger faith

841
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,860
in his word

842
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,160
that he's coming again

843
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,320
and that when he comes again

844
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,580
that will be an end

845
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,000
of every adversity

846
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,660
and of everything

847
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,380
that troubles us

848
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,820
oh the men

849
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,880
stood there of Galilee

850
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
gazing into heaven

851
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,940
and they were told

852
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,780
he's coming back

853
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,700
and in the word of God

854
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,020
he says

855
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm coming back

856
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,800
and when I come back

857
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,100
all the adversities

858
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
and the troubles

859
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,480
that sometimes

860
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,900
make life so miserable

861
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,080
they're going to come to an end

862
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,500
that which is eternal

863
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,660
shall be joy

864
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,300
and when we have

865
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,880
that assurance

866
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,940
when we turn to him

867
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,360
the assurance in his word

868
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,740
is coming back

869
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,460
this Christ

870
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,940
who will sit

871
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,800
at the right hand of God

872
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,320
it's not been a brush off

873
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,620
it's not been an abandonment

874
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,760
it's not a forsakenness

875
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,020
oh what a spiritual

876
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,260
shot in the arm

877
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,200
to live in the light

878
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
of the ascension

879
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,500
and when you and I

880
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,840
can live in the light of it

881
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,080
knowing again

882
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,500
the worthy apple of his eye

883
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,760
that you and I

884
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
are his greatest concern

885
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,240
as though he had

886
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,520
no one else to care about

887
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,180
except you

888
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,260
as though he had

889
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,180
no one else in the world

890
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,820
to care about

891
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,660
except me

892
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,480
with that concern

893
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,180
having us in his heart

894
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,680
when you and I

895
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
can realize that

896
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
then if we're living

897
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
in the light of the ascension

898
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
we will want to share

899
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,820
this Christ

900
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,760
with those who feel

901
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,500
abandoned

902
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,360
with those who feel

903
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
left behind

904
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,320
with those who feel

905
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,960
so forsaken

906
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,440
we said

907
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
what's wrong

908
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,380
in this world

909
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
we seem to be

910
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,080
coming apart

911
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,740
at the seams

912
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,920
especially on our

913
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,820
college campuses

914
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,540
what's wrong

915
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,320
men burning draft cards

916
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,360
rioting

917
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,300
again

918
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,260
college students

919
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,140
turning away

920
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,700
from

921
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,500
everything that you and I

922
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,360
seemingly think

923
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,220
is worthwhile

924
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,900
this unrest

925
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,480
what's wrong

926
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,420
on the campus

927
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,220
Dr. Joyce

928
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,180
brothers

929
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,200
I think you have

930
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,340
probably seen her

931
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,040
on television

932
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
a noted psychologist

933
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
made a study

934
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,800
of college students

935
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,940
and it's rather

936
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,560
revealing

937
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,700
she tells us this

938
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,780
the second largest

939
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,880
cause of death

940
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,240
among college students

941
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,800
can you imagine

942
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,480
what it is

943
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,220
the first largest

944
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,360
cause of death

945
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,460
among college students

946
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,180
is accidents

947
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,580
the greater number

948
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,540
of college students

949
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,000
that die

950
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,900
die by accident

951
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,100
34%

952
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,620
of college students

953
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,480
that die

954
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,920
that's one

955
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,500
in every three

956
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,120
college students

957
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,060
that die

958
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,500
Dr. Joyce

959
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,980

1168
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,660
oh

1169
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,180
when you

1170
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,520
think the

1171
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,140
world is

1172
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,660
down

1173
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,000
and you

1174
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,180
think

1175
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,400
there's

1176
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,860
no reason

1177
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,440
for living

1178
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,600
why don't

1179
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,880
you come

1180
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,300

1181
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,680
church

1182
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,640
and just

1183
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,100
sit and

1184
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,400
look at

1185
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,040
these windows

1186
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,500
they're

1187
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,080
priceless

1188
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,560
there aren't

1189
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,300
any finer

1190
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,160
stained glass

1191
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,760
windows in

1192
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,360
this part of

1193
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,800
the country

1194
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
believe me

1195
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,040
they're not

1196
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,920
excelled in

1197
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,520
any church

1198
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,900
in this

1199
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,500
community

1200
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,920
you can

1201
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,600
just sit

1202
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,160
down with

1203
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,680
your thoughts

1204
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,040

1205
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,640

1208
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,940
about you

1209
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,100
no one

1210
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,420
will ever

1211
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
kidnap you

1212
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,880

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,540
tickled to

1226
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,100

1227
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,720

00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,260
that boy

1262
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,800
may be

1263
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,260
tortured

1270
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,760
otherwise

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,360

happen

1285
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,560
because

00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,440
there's

1287
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,840
