 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let us hear the word of God as we find that's written back in the Old Testament in the 122nd Psalm, the sixth verse. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Now may the words of my mouth and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight. O Lord our strength and our redeemer. Amen. Good morning dear friends in Christ Jesus. This is a beautiful Sunday in July and I hope that all of us are happy to be here in God's house in order to worship Him. You have heard me say that today is the fourth Sunday after Trinity. You and I when we have looked on our calendars also say today is also the fourth of July. When we hear fourth of July mentioned I'm sure that we as Americans and as Christians we say to ourselves that brings back this date July the fourth 1776. That means that today our nation is celebrating its 195th birthday. We may say to ourselves as citizens and as Christians of this beloved country does the word of God have a message for a nation when it celebrates its birthday? I'm sure that as we turn to God's word that it does and I have just read from the word of God from the Old Testament we find the psalmist talking about the fact that he was invited by his friends to go to Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the capital of his nation and he was invited to go there with friends and also there was located the temple. He said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord our feet shall stand within thy gates O Jerusalem. He was thrilled to pieces in order to go to the capital city and to the temple. And as they went bending we are told that he said to those who were with him he says pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Let's pray for the peace of our nation. When would I say today on this 195th birthday what is God's message to us? The psalmist and the word of God he calls to you and to me as American Christians pray for the peace. Oh pray I plead with you pray and ask God to take care of the peace the welfare the goodness the well-being of your nation. And you may say to me today preacher that sounds good but what good is prayer to you? You mean to stand up today in this 20th century and to tell us that it does some good to pray for our nation just because the psalmist and the word of God he said pray for the peace for the well-being of Jerusalem. Do you mean to say that prayer does any good? You may say what good are pious words with perhaps a nasal twang what good does it do? You may say preacher this is the 20th century tell it as it is. What good does it do to pray for our nation but on this the 195th birthday of your beloved land and mine the word of God and the psalmist call pray keep on praying for the peace for the well-being of your nation and all because we have every assurance that when we pray for the good and the welfare of our nation it does change things it does do some good it brings about results that you and I could never dream of. You may say preacher you have to prove that let's see and together as we turn to the word of God and the promises there let's ask ourselves when we pray for the peace for the welfare of our nation what does it mean? We may say to ourselves how does it change things? How does it do good for this nation in which you and I live? Let's know in the first place that when you and I pray for the peace the well-being the good of our nation that it means this that we thank God for the privilege of religious liberty which you and I enjoy in this beloved land. We could come to church this morning this is the kind of a land we have and sometimes we forget when we think about the Declaration of Independence a win in the course of human events and when we think about the Constitution we the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union we sometimes forget the background we say why did our forefathers come to the new world and behind it one of the great and supreme things was this that they might worship God according to the dictates of their conscience. If you and I have ever been in Rome and been in the catacombs there we know what the early century Christians had to endure they had to go underground because they were not permitted by law to worship God and to worship their Lord Jesus Christ and so they went underground. You and I have the privilege and we thank God this morning as we pray for the peace of Jerusalem we pray for the peace of our nation thank God that we've got the privilege of assembling ourselves of coming into God's house and hearing the glorious message of Jesus Christ that God's son loved you and me so much that he came out of the ivory palaces and came into this world and became a human being born of the Virgin Mary for you and me and he died God died for you and me that in that sacrifice on Calvary you and I might be forgiven our sins deliver from an eternity in hell and assured of eternal life. This is the privilege that we have in this nation and you may say when we thank God and we pray oh that's more than just a couple of pious words with a nasal twine when we thank God for those blessings then what? You and I as American Christians we stand as reminders to this nation that the greatest gift of all is the gift of Jesus Christ and life and salvation in him. You and I can never dream of how much good that means when American Christians stand to remind the people of this world Jesus Christ and life and salvation in him this is the greatest gift who can measure what's good we say to ourselves you say pray for the peace of Jerusalem pray for the peace of this nation what good does it do preacher tell it like it is what good does prayer do in the 20th century just a couple of pious words and praises with a nasal twine oh no when you and I pray for the peace of this nation it means that we pray to God and we ask him for courage that we may witness for Jesus Christ. Oh we could spend the rest of the morning saying all the things that are wrong with this nation we can say why is it oh man's inhumanity to man and we talk about man's hostility and the names that we call one another it's a widey or blacky or it's white trash or it's nigger or it's heeny or it's deagle or it's a wop and we say to ourselves what's wrong in poverty and you can add it all up and those are only symptoms they're only syndromes they're symptoms of a terrible disease and that disease is what the human heart the human heart when general Douglas MacArthur was asked what's wrong and what ails the world he said it's not of the flesh but it's of the spirit when you and I ask God in prayer for this nation we have the courage to go out and say here's Jesus Christ he alone changes human hearts he is the one that transforms life there's the trouble inside man is hopelessly sinful and because man comes into the world with hearts that are filled with hatred and violence towards each other man there's got to be a regeneration there's got to be a new birth when you and I go out and we testify to that then you say what good does that do when we pray and ask God for courage who can measure it who could ever dream what it does because it means that there will be followers who will allow Christ to come into their hearts and transform their lives then they will look at others as being equal before the cross of Jesus Christ and being alike precious when Charles Evans Hughes who was the chief justice of the United States joined the church one Sunday there was a black man alongside of him Charles Evans Hughes turned and he said the ground before the cross is level when you and I as Christians when we as American citizens when we can say to ourselves Christ has transformed me and therefore standing at the cross every man is equal in the sight of God and every man is just as precious as I am who can measure the good oh we say to ourselves what good is a prayer what good are a few pious words with a nasal twang the psalmist says pray for the peace for the good the well-being the well part of Jerusalem on this 195th birthday of this beloved nation today we're called upon you pray for this nation what does it mean what's more than a few pious words to be sure when you and I pray for the good of this nation it also means this that we confess to God our guilt in the nation's sins and we stop blaming it on to our forefathers and to those that preceded us oh we can get pretty cynical at times can't we I've had people say to me I didn't ask to be born and to come into this world I wasn't asked whether I wanted to be born I say you listen friend no but God caused you to be born don't forget that you didn't ask me to did I and it's past time isn't to say look at the kind of world that's been handed out may I say friend what kind of a world has been handed any of us all that I know from childhood on is war and man's hostility and man's brutality that God put you and me into this world and it's about time that we stand and we say and our prayer when we pray for the wealth of the nation God begin with me my heart is selfish I am filled with guilt I've got race prejudice I am out after myself the great perpendicular pronoun I when we allow Jesus Christ then to come to bring us to repentance and to forgiveness and we stop blaming those that have gone before well then what happens then there comes into your heart and mind Christian love and that's the kind that is born of faith in Jesus Christ it's the kind that looks at every man regardless of the color of his skin whether he's white or black or yellow or whether he's brown and we say I love that man that I want him saved and I'm going to treat him that way you and I that's what prayer means when we stand and we can pray like that and we say for our nation any man that I need I'm gonna love him to heaven and I'm going to treat him in mercy and kindness and goodwill because I want him in eternity with Jesus Christ with me and I challenge you there isn't any problem there are no syndromes there are no diseases and illnesses and symptoms that can't be remedied by the panacea when Jesus Christ starts in your life and mine we say this is the 195th birthday of our nation we say what do you what can we do about it what does the word of God have to say God again through his words says pray for the peace of Jerusalem you pray for the welfare of your nation for its good we can be cynical and say what good are a few pious praises with a measles playing is that all it means but when we pray for the peace of our nation it means that that we stop offering God a two-bit prayer and expect a million dollar blessing what kind of prayers do you and I pray are they two-bit prayers is that all they are just a bit of a pious praise and a nice sounding word with a nasal twang that it sounds so anxious and it sounds so holy and so sacred where's the heart when we turn to the word of God Jesus used to spend all night in prayer when you see him in Gethsemane's garden when he prayed so fervently that the again the sweat was drops of blood that fell from his face there was again a perseverance there was a holding on what kind of a prayer do you and I pray just a few glib where where's the heart where is the heart it is just a little two-bit 25 cent prayer we expect at least a million bucks in blessings is that the kind of praying that you and I are going to do for our nation when we're going to stand before God and say it's going to come from the heart it's going to come from one that is repented who shall stand in the holy hill of the Lord he that has clean hands and a pure heart you and I approached the throne of grace and asked God great blessing in Jesus Christ we hold on I stood at the river Jabbok there it was that Jacob wrestled with the aims of the Lord with God himself, get along for dear life I won't let you go until you bless me you gotta forgive me and he held on the Lord Jesus forgave him who was the son of God that special age you hold on remember when God came to visit Abraham God told Abraham I'm going to describe the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah did Abraham say all right that's all right God but he turned to God in prayer and he said wait a minute supposing God there are 50 righteous people left in Sodom and Gomorrah would you save the city and God said yeah I'll save them and he said but supposing there's only 45 will you save the city of Sodom God said yes but he kept on praying supposing there's only 40 will you save the city and God said yes then he said there's only 30 God will you save the cities God said yes and he kept on supposing there's only 20 God said God forgive me I'm coming back again God supposing there's only 10 righteous people in those cities will you save them God said yes I'll say when there were less than 10 Abraham fought for Sodom and Gomorrah in prayer he wrestled with God because there weren't 10 that I've destroyed the cities you and I say what good does it do to wrestle with God in prayer and stop the two bit prayers pray in Jesus name and hold on for dear life why it brings us a shortage more than you like and every why is America standing today it's standing today because it's got some righteous people that's why Sodom and Gomorrah would be standing with 10 and I say what good does it do to prayer preacher this is the 20th century what good does prayer do whether you believe it or whether you don't that's up to you that this great land stands because there are righteous people the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous person avails much and don't you forget it that's why it's standing we talk about the birthday of this land that we love and we are called upon to pray we say what good does prayer do oh we can be so cynical have an hazel twang stand up there in the pulpit and tell us to pray what does it all mean prayer doesn't do any good does it change things oh yes because when you and I pray it means this that we thank God we thank God sincerely for the care and the protection that we've enjoyed in this nation what about the fact that this nation protects you and me it's a nation of law and it's a nation of order isn't it yes we talk about the Bill of Rights we talk about the amendments again we talk about liberty but under law as you and I know your liberty stops at the end of my nose my liberty stops at the end of your nose it isn't that every man can do as he pleases it's liberty under law this is a nation of law and a nation of order when we look out and say look at this lawlessness look at again the disrespect for law and order look at those who can who are law to themselves who care nothing about the fact that this is a nation that stands under our Eastern District met in Washington DC this year one of our pastors was mugged he was robbed and his jaw was broken and almost killed right in daylight on the streets of Washington DC we said oh what's happening when you and I can pray and thank God that this is a nation of law and order then what does it mean it means that in your life and mine we're going to see to it that we're going to be examples of those who are going to stand for law and for obedience to government you and I can't dream of what it means we're going to have to set some examples as Americans and as Christians we're going to be very careful we live within law this is a nation of law and order there need to be some examples have you and I failed is this what's wrong what is this beloved land of ours we talk about praying is it just simply a nice nasal twang with a couple of pious words what about this thing of praying does it do any good let's bear this in mind that when you and I pray for the peace of Jerusalem and we pray again for its well-being of our nation it means this that we have the courage to bear witness of this then a man's conscience if it's going to be a reliable guide is going to have to be enlightened by the word of God oh this thing of conscience we're hearing a lot about it conscience is that knowledge of right and wrong that God wrote into the heart of our first parents Adam and Eve it's that knowledge that all of us have we have a semblance we have a dim knowledge of what is right and wrong but oh it's so dim that it needs to be educated it needs to be taught it needs to be enlightened because conscience can be wrong when you and I pray for our nation we ask God give us courage to tell a man your conscience is no better than its enlightenment have you been enlightened by the word of God that it has grown but now it becomes an intelligible assure a safe guy we talk about war people are saying does a nation have the right to wage war can you be a Christian and go to war when you read the word of God Romans 13 Paul leaves no doubt that we are to be subject to again the higher powers government and that it bears not the sword in vain that the government has the right the word of God does not forbid all killing but it forbids all murdering there's a difference when the government can bear the sword in order to punish evil doers when a nation's safety and is in jeopardy and government has the right to use the sword you can be a Christian you can bear arms but all this presents problems doesn't it we say to ourselves how about the Pentagon Papers are we being deceived can you believe anybody you and I think that we can live in a nation whereby there may not be some who may deceive us we're going to be deceived have you and I forgot to though that when we stand before the bar of divine justice you and I stand as individuals that we shall stand personally accountable to God the nation has the right to bear arms to be sure when is the war justified these are some of the problems we say how about my conscience can I just say no when you go back to the early church when some of the disciples were placed in jail because they were preaching they were told you've got to stop preaching the name of Christ if you don't you're going to go to jail you're going to be killed then it was that Peter said we must obey God rather than man whenever the government tells you and me that I've got to shut up about Jesus Christ in other words that I've got to throw away my eternal life in him that my eternal salvation is in jeopardy because of him then the word of God says now you will be God rather than and listen when you and I as Christians we today pray for the peace of our nation enlightened by the word of God we can stand as a testimony and I do it today my life I can testify to this nation mine I've never been asked to do anything that has jeopardized my eternal salvation in Jesus Christ have you I have not listen to me as a genius I know this my nation is so big that if any one of you listening right now would say that my conscience tells me what is wrong my conscience tells me to kill under any circumstances are you can be a conscientious objector and you tell the government if your soul is in jeopardy and you say I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I'm going to kill you I would lose Christ this government is big enough to exempt you from services and some of you say oh Russia is so fine I'd like to see you find a conscientious objector in Russia when you're fine you be sure and bring me a picture give a shot because the state is God's there some of us think it's so wonderful and I was in Jerusalem I had two Arab boys plating with me to bring them to America we'll live in your home and we'll be serviced so we don't expect any money we'll wait on if you just let us come to America rather strange isn't it and yet some of us again we like to sell this nation short praying for the peace that you've used what does it mean it means that we turn to God and we remind ourselves and we thank God for this promise that the only institution on earth that God has given his absolute security about that it's going to last till Christ comes again to church not anyone government what is the word of God to Jesus as the gates of hell shall not prevail against my church one institution I know is going on to the end and there isn't anybody's going to destroy and that's the Church of Jesus Christ you don't have that promise for any government in the world where are the governments of Assyria and where are the Babylonians and where are the Medes and the Persians and where are the great Greek government where are the Roman legions and where is the northern kingdom of Israel where it is the southern kingdom is of those that have gone down we have no problem promise that any nation in the government is going to stand but we do have the promise that again the church the kingdom of God is going to continue when you and I pray and thank God that the church is going to come through then we're going to see to it that in our lives we are going to live moral lives we are going to live your lives so that God sees us who will live Christ will continue to protect this nation and keep it from discussion but will keep it from being destroyed tomorrow it isn't a big army or a big navy it's the fact that there are Christians who are praying who are showing their Christianity lives of morality and impurity let's keep these homes together let's keep these children as God wants them to be kept let's live in the moral standards that God has given this nation depends upon it don't you ever tell me that prayer doesn't do any good it doesn't change prayer does more good than you and I could ever dream it means when you and I pray that we turn to God and we say to God God you have the ultimate the last word as regards the destiny of this country this nation stands why because God's letting it stand why it's here you may say oh you're so naive creature you mean to tell me that God because you're saying about he's got the whole wide world in his name I do mean to tell me in this 20th century that this nation's saying yeah that's what I mean yeah you can call me naive and you can call me simple and you can call me anything you want to call me but I remembered as I read back in the word of God that there was King Hezekiah who was king of the southern kingdom and I remember when Sennacherib came and surround the city and ready to destroy the nation and Hezekiah had nothing but he got down and prayed and he called upon the people to pray that God would deliver them and that night God sent a plague the word of God said and 185,000 Assyrians were dead the next morning and I ain't dead around the city of Jerusalem I still believe keep running the show the ultimate word the last word God Almighty is going to say that affect this nation and affects this nation that you and I as Christians we're going to keep on praying we're going to pray like we've never prayed before for the welfare and the good of this beloved life when we pray for the peace of Jerusalem it also means that we pray for our sons and daughters in the armed services of our country we pray for the end of hostilities in Vietnam you know we've been doing that every Sunday they say pray for our boys yes why because God says not even a sparrow falls to the ground without his will when we've got our own flesh and blood in the armed services especially in places of danger and we pray to God for them you and I know this that nothing will happen to them unless God allows us if a sparrow doesn't fall without his permission your son and daughter will not fall except he allows it we've got this promise from him that if he allows it to come he overrules it for their eternal good we believe that that means that as Christians when we pray for our sons and daughters in the service we pray for an end of this war because God can do all things that whatever happens in the providence of God we accept and we go on believing and we stand as living monuments in this nation that Christ is worthwhile that God is worthwhile I don't suppose you particularly noticed when the flags came in this morning the Christian flag was carried by one of our deacons I know that you noticed or not the American flag was not carried by one of our deacons I shall not name him because he stands as a symbol but the man that carried the American flag is the father of boy that was killed in Vietnam at the second service the American flag is going to be carried by a father whose son is missing in battle in Vietnam I call these men for a purpose and I ask them would you carry the American flag in the service Sunday both of those men they know the price of war came back to me yes it means men in our church you know what war means I'll tell you over there that's a certain that's saying something to this nation in Jesus Christ God you don't make any mistakes there's a great day coming whatever happens to be safe and to be reunited with our loved ones it will more than compensate for the worse that will come pray for the peace of Jerusalem Americans and as Christians we live under two flags. Oh to God that we can pray for the welfare of our nation and know that it does do some good that we can stand and we can face the Christian flag and we can say I pledge allegiance to the Christian flag and to the church for which it stands one Savior universal with life and salvation for all we can also stand as Americans and as Christians and say so glory say I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all we live under two flags we ask God oh took to preserve this nation Francis Scott Key still asks an important question he who wrote the Star-Spangled Banner he asked oh say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the Twilight's last evening can you still see in the dawn what we saw in the twilight last night we say what was it whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight or the ramparts we watch were so gallantly streaming it was old glory the flag you still see it and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there and he asked oh say does that star-spangled banner get way for the land of the free 195 years old your nation mind the psalmist is pray pray like you've never prayed before pray for the peace of Jerusalem they shall let's pray that this nation under God of the people by the people before the people shall not perish in the earth the peace of God which passeth all human understanding keep and unite your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus into life everlasting let us remain standing and let us turn to the flag let us sing the first stand of the Star-Spangled Banner Oh
